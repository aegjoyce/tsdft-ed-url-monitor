    "text": "Cuts and grazes\n\nMost cuts and grazes can be treated at home and will start to heal in a few days. But some wounds may need to be treated by a medical professional if there's a risk of infection or the cut is serious.\n\nHow to treat a cut or graze yourself\n\nYou can treat a cut or graze yourself by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound, and covering it with a plaster or dressing. This will help stop it getting infected.\nIf it's painful, you can take painkillers such as\nparacetamol\nor\nibuprofen\n(but do not give\naspirin\nto children under 16).\nWhat to do if the wound is bleeding a lot\nCheck the wound and make sure there's nothing stuck in it.\nIf there's nothing in the wound, put pressure on it using a bandage or a clean, folded cloth (such as a tea towel) for 10 minutes.\nIf there's something stuck in the wound, do not try to take it out. Make sure not to press down on the object. Press firmly either side of it to push the edges of the wound together.\nIf the wound is on your hand or arm, raise it above your head. If the wound is on your lower limb, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce the blood flow.\nWhen the bleeding has stopped, firmly wrap a new bandage over the first cloth or bandage.\nIf the wound keeps bleeding, leave the first bandage in place and add another one. Keep pressing firmly on the wound for another 10 minutes.\nHow to clean and dress a cut or graze\nIf the bleeding has stopped, you can clean a small wound and then put a plaster or dressing over it.\nWash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Put on disposable gloves if you have some.\nClean the wound by rinsing it with bottled or tap water, or by using sterile wipes.\nClean the skin around the wound using soap and water or antiseptic \u2013 but try not to get antiseptic into the wound.\nPat the area dry using a gauze swab or a clean tea towel.\nPut on a sterile dressing or a plaster.\nKeep the dressing clean by changing it as often as you need. You can take it off after a few days, once the wound has closed.\n\nInformation:\n\nFind out more\nHow to apply plasters and other dressings\nHow to apply a bandage\n\nUrgent advice:\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n\na wound has soil, pus or body fluids in it, or it's still dirty after cleaning it\nyou were bitten by a person or a wild or stray animal\na cut is swollen, red and getting more painful or pus is coming out of it\na cut is larger than around 5cm (2 inches)\nyou've cut yourself and also feel generally unwell or have a high temperature\nYou can call 111 or\nget help from 111 online\n.\n\nImmediate action required:\nCall 999 or go to A&E if:\n\nyou have a cut and cannot stop the bleeding\nthe blood comes out in spurts and is bright red and hard to control\nyou lose feeling near the wound or have trouble moving it\nyou have a bad cut on your face or the palm of your hand\nthe wound is very large or deep\nthere's something stuck in the cut, such as a shard of glass \u2013 do not try to take it out yourself\n\nFind your nearest A&E\n\nInformation:\n\nDo not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nBring any medicines you take with you.\n\nTreatments for cuts and grazes\n\nHow a cut or graze is treated will depend on how bad it is and if there's a risk of it becoming infected.\nThe cut will be cleaned and closed with either stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is put over it.\nBut the wound may not be closed straight away if it's infected or there's a risk it may get infected.\nYou may also need to have an injection to prevent\ntetanus\nor be given antibiotics if the cut could be infected.\n\nPage last reviewed: 06 June 2022\n\nNext review due: 06 June 2025",

Both are treated in the same way.\nA burn is caused by dry heat\u00a0\u2013 by an iron or fire, for example.\u00a0A\u00a0scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam.\n\nCredit:\nSCOTT CAMAZINE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/98607/view\n\nBurns can be very painful and may cause:\nred or peeling skin\nblisters\nswelling\nwhite or charred skin\nThe amount of pain you feel is not always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless.\n\nTreating burns and scalds\n\nTo treat a burn, follow the\nfirst aid\nadvice below:\nimmediately get the person away from the heat source\nto stop the burning\nremove any clothing or jewellery\nthat's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies,\u00a0but do not\u00a0move anything that's stuck to the skin\ncool the burn\nwith cool or lukewarm running water for\u00a020 to 30 minutes\u00a0\u2013 do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter\nmake sure the person keeps warm\nby\u00a0using a blanket,\u00a0for example,\u00a0but take care not to rub it against the burnt area\nafter cooling the burn, cover the burn\nby placing a layer of cling film over it\u00a0\u2013 a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand\nuse painkillers\nsuch as\nparacetamol\nor\nibuprofen\nto treat\u00a0any\u00a0pain\nraise the affected area if possible\n\u2013 this helps to reduce swelling\nif it's an\n\nacid or chemical burn\n, dial 999\n, carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible\nRead more about\ntreating burns and scalds\n.\n\nWhen to get medical attention\n\nDepending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.\nFor minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.\nMore serious burns require professional medical attention.\nYou should go to a hospital A&E department for:\nall chemical and electrical burns\nlarge or deep burns\n\u2013 any burn bigger than the injured person's hand\nburns that cause white or charred skin\n\u2013 any size\nburns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals\nIf someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention.\nSome symptoms may be delayed and can include:\ncoughing\na sore throat\ndifficulty breathing\nfacial burns\nPeople at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under 10 years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald.\nThe size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied.\u00a0In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended.\nRead more about:\nrecovering from burns and scalds\ncomplications of burns and scalds\n\nTypes of burn\n\nBurns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected.\nYour skin has 3 layers:\nthe epidermis\n\u2013 the outer layer of skin\nthe dermis\n\u2013 the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles\nthe subcutaneous fat, or subcutis\n\u2013 the deeper layer of fat and tissue\nThere are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:\nsuperficial epidermal burn\n\u2013\u00a0where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered\nsuperficial dermal burn\n\u2013\u00a0where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters\ndeep dermal or partial thickness burn\n\u2013\u00a0where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless\nfull thickness burn\n\u2013 where all 3 layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. It may also be painless\n\nPreventing burns and scalds\n\nMany severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children.\nExamples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include:\nkeeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible\ntesting the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath\nkeeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach\nkeeping hot drinks well away from young children\nRead more about\npreventing burns and scalds\n.\n\nFurther advice\n\nIf you need advice about a burn or scald, you can:\ncall 111 or\nget help from 111 online\nspeak to a GP\n\nPage last reviewed: 23 June 2022\n\nNext review due: 23 June 2025",

    "text": "Knee pain and other running injuries\n\nRunning injuries can affect anyone, from experienced runners who push themselves hard, to beginners whose muscles are not used to running.\nWhatever your injury, it's important to listen to your body. Do not run if you're in pain, and only start running again when you have recovered sufficiently.\nBelow are 5 of the most common running injuries. Find out how to spot the symptoms, what causes the injuries, and what to do if you get one, including when to get medical help.\nYou'll also find tips on how to avoid becoming injured in the first place, such as choosing the right shoes and warming up properly.\n\n1. Knee pain\nKnee pain, also called runner's knee, can have many causes, such as swelling under the kneecap.\nWhat does runner's knee feel like?\nDuring your run, you may develop pain at the front of the knee, around the knee, or behind the kneecap. The pain may be dull, or it could be sharp and severe.\nWhat should I do about\u00a0runner's knee?\nTo help knee pain when you're at home, try holding ice or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a damp tea towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes, a few times a day. Never put ice directly on your skin.\nIf the pain is severe or the knee is swollen, see a GP straight away.\nIf your knee pain is not severe, stop running and get it checked by a GP or physiotherapist if the pain does not go away after a week.\nThey can also recommend stretches or exercises to help you recover.\nCan I still run with a painful knee?\nDo not run if you have pain in your knee. If you still feel pain after a week's rest, see a GP or physiotherapist.\nHow soon you can start running again will depend on the cause of your knee pain and how severe it is. A GP or physiotherapist can advise you.\nTry these\nknee exercises for runners\n.\n\n2. Achilles pain\nThe achilles tendon is the tough, rubbery cord at the back of the ankle that links the muscle to the bone.\nRegular running can cause wear and tear to the tendon over time.\nWhat does\u00a0achilles pain\u00a0feel like?\nYou may have pain and swelling at the back of the ankle or heel. The pain may be minor but continuous, or it could be sudden and sharp. It may be worse first thing in the morning.\nWhat should I do about achilles pain when I run?\nTo treat achilles pain at home, apply wrapped up ice to the area if you can feel a lump there (never put ice directly on your skin). You can also gently massage the area with your fingers.\nYou could also try using heel wedges in your shoes. Get advice about this from a sports or running shop.\nSee a GP or a physiotherapist if you have achilles pain that does not disappear after 2 to 3 weeks.\nIf you have a sudden, sharp pain, your achilles tendon may have torn. See a GP straight away if this is the case.\nCan I still run with achilles pain?\nA sharp pain will stop you running altogether. Even if the pain is not severe, it's a good idea to rest until the pain goes, and get it checked if it does not go away.\n\n3. Shin pain\nShin pain occurs on the front of the leg, below the knee. It's often referred to as shin splints.\nWhat do\u00a0shin splints\u00a0feel like?\nRunners are often aware of a dull pain in the shin, but carry on running.\nBut this can cause increasing damage to the area, which can lead to a sudden sharp pain that stops you running altogether.\nWhat should I do about shin pain?\nPain can be relieved by applying wrapped up ice to the area regularly for the first few days (never put ice directly on your skin).\nSee a GP or a physiotherapist if the area is swollen, the pain's severe, or it does not improve in a few weeks.\nCan I still run with shin splints?\nShin pain is likely to stop you running for a while. Take a break for a few weeks before beginning again slowly.\nFind out more about shin splints\n\n4. Heel pain\nPain or swelling in the heel or bottom of the foot can occur if you suddenly start doing a lot more running, run uphill, or your shoes are not supportive enough or are worn out.\nThe medical name for heel pain is\nplantar fasciitis\n.\nWhat does\u00a0runner's heel pain\u00a0feel like?\nHeel pain is often sharp and occurs when you put weight on the heel. It can feel like someone's sticking something sharp in your heel, or as if you're walking on sharp stones.\nWhat should I do about heel pain?\nApplying wrapped up ice to the area can help. You can do this by freezing a small bottle of water, placing it on the floor and rolling it back and forth under your foot for about 15 to 20 minutes. Never place ice directly on your skin.\nStop running and see a GP straight away if there's a lot of swelling in the heel or the area under your foot. Otherwise, see a GP if the pain does not go away.\nCan I still run with a painful heel?\nYou will not be able to run with heel pain. If you treat the pain early enough, it'll normally go away in a few weeks, after which you should be able to start running again.\nFind out more about heel pain\n\n5. Muscle strains\nCommon strains caused by running are in the hamstring muscles (which run down the back of the thigh) or calf muscles.\nStrains often affect new runners, whose muscles are not used to running.\nWhat does\u00a0muscle strain\u00a0feel like?\nThe pain of a muscle strain is often sudden and feels as if someone has kicked you in the area of your calf or hamstring.\nWhat should I do about a muscle strain?\nMost strains can be treated at home. Stop running immediately and apply ice to the painful area up to 20 minutes a few times a day (do not put ice directly on your skin).\nKeeping your leg elevated and supported with a pillow will help reduce swelling.\nFind out more about treating strains\nCan I still run with a muscle strain?\nYou will not be able to run with a muscle strain. The time it takes for a strain to heal and for you to start running again can take months, depending on how severe the muscle strain is.\n\nTips for preventing injury\nWear the right shoes\nIt's important to buy the correct running shoes, and it's best to go to a running shop to get fitted. But you do not have to spend a lot of money.\nExpensive shoes may just be more durable and lightweight, so more suitable for people running long distances. All running shoe brands make cheaper versions that are suitable for beginners.\nWarm up and cool down\nIt's essential to warm up properly before you start running. Five to 10 minutes of brisk walking or gentle jogging before you start will warm your muscles up and help prevent injury.\nTo cool down, carry on running at an easier pace or walk for 5 to 10 minutes. This will help your body recover after your run.\nBuild up slowly\nDo not be tempted to increase the intensity or distance of your running too quickly. Do a similar run at least 3 or 4 times before you increase your pace or distance.\nThe\nCouch to 5K plan\nis perfect as it builds up the distance gradually. The plan is suitable for beginners and will get you running 3 times a week, building up to 5km in 9 weeks.\n\nStaying motivated if you have an injury\nBeing injured can be very frustrating. If you're new to running, you might be tempted to give up at the first sign of injury.\nHaving a specific goal, such as a 5km race or charity run, will help you stay motivated through injury.\nIf you have something to work towards, you'll be much more likely to get back into running once you've recovered.\nRunning with a partner is also a great way to stay motivated. If they carry on running while you're injured, you'll want to get back out there once you're better as you will not want to let them down.\n\nPage last reviewed: 25 November 2022\n\nNext review due: 25 November 2025",

It can also help you take deep breaths and sleep more comfortably.\n\nIf over the counter medication is ineffective it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your healthcare professional.\n\nMore about taking painkillers\n\nPreventing a chest infection\n\nYour risk of getting a chest infection is higher after a chest or rib injury. To help prevent this it\u2019s recommended you do some breathing exercises. These help your lungs expand fully.\n\nIf you\u2019ve injured your chest or ribs you should try to do these exercises every hour while you\u2019re awake. Do this until you can breathe freely without pain.\n\nAim to take a deep breath in, hold for 4 seconds and then a slow, relaxed breath out. You should try to do this 4 times each hour. Try and do these sitting upright.\n\nHow to cough with a chest or rib injury\n\nCoughing when you have a chest or rib injury can be painful. Rather than coughing as you would normally, try to use a huff instead.\n\nA huff is a fast breath out, like you would do to steam up a pair of glasses or mirror.\n\nDo 2 or 3 huffs at a time after breathing exercises. This should help make it easier for you to cough up any phlegm. It may help to reduce your pain to hug a pillow or cushion to your chest as you do this.\n\nSleeping after a chest or rib injury\n\nYou might need to change how you sleep. You might find it more comfortable to sleep in an upright position supported by more pillows. Try to return to a normal sleeping position after a few days.\n\nIf you wear a bra, it may be helpful to wear it when sleeping as some people find this more comfortable. You could try a soft bra without an underwire.\n\nKeeping active during your recovery\n\nKeeping active is an essential part of your recovery. Try to increase your activity gradually.\n\nIt\u2019s best to avoid long periods of bed rest.\n\nPacing your activity levels\n\nIt\u2019s normal for these injuries to be painful and limit your movement. However, too much rest can slow down your recovery.\n\nAs soon as you can, start moving and using the affected area. A little movement or activity is better than nothing.\n\nMovement is likely to be painful to start with.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be pain free to start moving, Try to keep your activities within a manageable pain level for you.\n\nHow to tell if you\u2019re moving at the right level\n\nTo help you pace your activities at the right level, you can rate your pain out of 10. On this scale 0 is no pain, 10 being the worst pain you\u2019ve ever had, for example:\n\n0 to 3 \u2013 minimal pain\n\n4 to 5 \u2013 acceptable pain\n\n6 to 10 \u2013 excessive pain\n\nPain during and after activity\n\nActivity can increase discomfort as your body gets used to regaining your activity levels.\n\nAim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the level of activity by:\n\nreducing the number of times you do a movement\n\nreducing the pace of an activity\n\nincreasing rest time between activities\n\nRecovery timescales\n\nMost of the healing happens between 6 to 8 weeks after your injury.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This usually happens when you try activities you haven\u2019t done for a while. It\u2019s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for a while after the injury.\n\nDriving\n\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.\n\nYou must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre. You should always be in full control of your vehicle.\n\nWork\n\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties initially.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work unless you require\na fit note\n.\n\nFalls\n\nIt\u2019s very common for a rib or chest injury to happen after a fall. There are many things that can\nincrease your risk of falling\n.\n\nFurther advice about preventing falls\n\nHelp and support\n\nSpeak to a healthcare professional if:\n\nyour symptoms haven\u2019t improved within 8 weeks of following this advice\n\nyour symptoms are worsening\n\nFind out\nhow to access MSK services in your area\n.\n\nWhen dealing with any health condition it\u2019s important to also look after\nyour mental wellbeing\nas this can impact your recovery.\n\nSource:\n\nNHS 24 MSK Clinical Advisory Group\n- Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated:\n\n27 January 2026\n\nHow can we improve this page?\n\nHelp us improve NHS inform\n\nThank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\nDon\u2019t include personal information e.g. name, location or any personal health conditions.\n\nEmail Address\n\ne.g. you@example.com\n\nMessage\n\nMaximum of 500 characters\n\nSend feedback\n\nAdd this page to\nInfo For Me",

    "text": "How and when to use chloramphenicol\n\nDosage\n\nChloramphenicol comes in different strengths. How much you use depends on what it's for and whether you're using the eyedrops, eye ointment or eardrops.\nHow to use chloramphenicol\nTo use all types of chloramphenicol:\nalways wash your hands before (and after) using chloramphenicol \u2013 this prevents you from passing the infection to the other eye or ear\nremove the cap just before using your medicine and replace it as soon as you've finished\ndo not touch the eye dropper or tube with your fingers\nmake sure the nozzle does not touch your eye or ear, or your skin\nuse a mirror to help you see what you're doing\ntilt your head back or to the side to put drops in your eyes or ears\nWhen you've finished your treatment, throw away any leftover medicine.\nHow to use eyedrops\nIf you're using 0.5% chloramphenicol eyedrops, put one drop into the affected eye every 2 hours (during waking hours) for the first 2 days. Then every 4 hours for the next 3 days, or as your doctor advises.\nTilt your head back and gently pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger. Hold the bottle over your eye and allow a single drop to fall into the space between your lower lid and your eye. Close your eye for a few minutes. Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.\nFor more severe infections, your doctor may recommend using ointment at bedtime and eyedrops during the day. This is because the ointment works better while you sleep. The eyedrops allow you to get on with your day as normal, as they do not affect your eyesight.\nHow to use eye ointment\nIf you're using 1% chloramphenicol eye ointment, apply it to the affected eye every 3 hours (during waking hours). Do this 3 to 4 times a day, or as your doctor advises.\nGently pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger and tilt your head back. Hold the tube with the nozzle close to your eye and gently squeeze about 1 centimetre of ointment into the space between your lower lid and your eye. Close your eye for a few minutes.\nWith more severe infections, your doctor may recommend using eye ointment at bedtime. This is because the ointment sticks to the surface of the eye and eyelid and works while you sleep.\nHow to use eardrops\nIf you're using 5% or 10% chloramphenicol eardrops, put 3 or 4 drops into the affected ear 2 to 3 times a day, or as your doctor advises.\nTilt your head and bring the tube up to the affected ear, with the dropper close to your ear hole. Squeeze the drops into your ear.\nIf you can, lie down for at least 10 minutes afterwards. Turn your head to one side, so your affected ear is towards the ceiling. After this, put some cotton wool in your ear.\nHow long to use it for\nEyedrops\nUse the drops for 5 days, even if your eye seems better.\nDo not use them for more than 5 days, unless your doctor tells you to. This is because your eyes can become more sensitive or you could get another eye infection.\nEye ointment\nUse the ointment until the eye appears normal and for 2 days afterwards. Do not use it for more than 5 days, unless your doctor tells you to.\nEardrops\nUse the drops for up to 1 week. Do not use the medicine for longer than this unless your doctor tells you to. This is because your ears can become more sensitive or you could get another ear infection.\nIf you forget to use it\nIf you forget to use chloramphenicol drops or ointment, use or apply it as soon as you remember. Then continue to use it at the usual time.\nIf you often forget to use your chloramphenicol, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.\nIf you use too much\nDo not worry if a few more drops of chloramphenicol accidentally fall into your eye or ear, or if you apply more of the ointment than you meant to.\n\nUrgent advice:\nContact 111 for advice now if:\n\nyou or your child swallow chloramphenicol ointment or drops\nGo to\n111.nhs.uk\nor call\n111\n. If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\nInformation:\n\nIf you need to go to\nA&E\n, do not drive. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nBring the chloramphenicol packet or leaflet inside it, any remaining medicine, and any other medicines you take.\n\nPage last reviewed: 9 February 2022\n\nNext review due: 9 February 2025",

It's a common sports injury and is treated using a splint.\n\nSymptoms of mallet finger\n\nIf you have mallet finger the tip of your finger will bend and you will not be able to straighten it.\n\nCredit:\nDR P. MARAZZI\u00a0/\u00a0SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n:\nhttps://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1063101/view\n\nYour finger may also be:\npainful or tender\nswollen or bruised\n\nUrgent advice:\nGet help from NHS 111 if:\n\nYou've injured your finger and:\nyou cannot straighten it\nit's painful or tender\nit's swollen or bruised\nYou can call 111 or\nget help from 111 online\n.\n\nThings you can do before you get medical help\n\nIf you think you have mallet finger, there are some things you can do while waiting for medical help.\n\nDo\n\nlift your hand up to reduce swelling\n\ntake painkillers to help ease the pain\n\nremove any rings from the finger\n\nTreatment for mallet finger\n\nIf you have mallet finger, the finger needs to be kept straight to let the injury heal.\nA doctor or nurse will put the finger in a splint, securing it with tape.

    "text": "Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy\n\nBleeding during pregnancy is relatively common and does not always mean there's a problem \u2013 but it\u00a0can be a dangerous sign.\n\nUrgent advice:\nCall your midwife or GP immediately if:\n\nyou have any bleeding from your vagina\n\nCauses of bleeding in early pregnancy\nImplantation bleeding\nIn early pregnancy, you might get some harmless light bleeding, called \"spotting\". This is when the developing embryo plants itself in the wall of your womb. This type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due.\nCervical changes\nPregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and this may sometimes cause bleeding \u2013 after sex, for example.\nMiscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\nDuring the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of\nmiscarriage\nor\nectopic pregnancy\n.\nIf you bleed at this stage of pregnancy and the pregnancy ends, there is no reason for you not to go on to have a successful pregnancy.\n\nTreating bleeding in early pregnancy\nYou may be offered a medicine called progesterone to stop bleeding in early pregnancy. This will only be recommended if you've had a scan to confirm you're pregnant and you've had a miscarriage before.\nYour doctor may recommend you take the medicine twice a day until you're 16 weeks pregnant.\n\nMiscarriage\nIf a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it's called a miscarriage. Around 1 in 5 pregnancies ends this way.\nMany early miscarriages (before 13 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. There can also be other causes of miscarriage, such as hormone or blood clotting problems.\nMost miscarriages occur during the first 12 weeks (3 months) of pregnancy and, sadly, most cannot be prevented. Other symptoms of miscarriage include:\ncramping and pain in your lower abdomen\na discharge or fluid from your vagina\na discharge of tissue from your vagina\nno longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick\nIf you have bleeding or any of these symptoms, contact your midwife or GP straightaway.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\nAn\nectopic pregnancy\nis when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, in the fallopian tube.\nIt can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg cannot develop properly outside the womb. The egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines.\nSymptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy but can happen later.\nOther signs of ectopic pregnancy can include:\ntummy pain low down which may be on one side\nvaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge\npain in the tip of your shoulder\ndiscomfort when peeing or pooing\nCall 111 if you have symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nCauses of bleeding in later pregnancy\nCervical changes\nThese can lead to\u00a0bleeding, particularly after sex.\nVaginal infections\nYour midwife or doctor can discuss tests and treatment with you.\nA 'show'\nThis is when the plug of mucus that has been in the cervix during pregnancy comes away, signalling\u00a0that the cervix is getting ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself.\nFind out about the\nsigns of labour\nand\nwhat happens in labour and birth\n.\nPlacental abruption\nThis is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the womb wall. Placental abruption usually causes stomach pain, and this may occur\u00a0even if there is no bleeding.\nLow-lying placenta (placenta praevia)\nThis is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the womb, near to or covering the cervix. Bleeding from a low-lying placenta can be very heavy, and put you and your baby at risk.\nYou may be advised to\u00a0go into hospital\u00a0for emergency treatment, and\u00a0a\ncaesarean section\nwill usually be recommended.\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website has more information on placenta praevia\n.\nVasa praevia\nThis is a rare condition where\u00a0the baby's blood vessels run through the membranes covering the cervix.\nWhen your waters break,\u00a0these vessels may be torn and cause vaginal bleeding. The baby can lose a life-threatening amount of blood.\n\nFinding out the cause of bleeding in pregnancy\nTo work out what is causing the\u00a0bleeding, you may need to have a vaginal or pelvic examination, an ultrasound scan or blood tests to check your hormone levels.\nYour doctor will also ask you about other symptoms, such as cramp, pain and dizziness. Sometimes it might not be possible to find out what caused the bleeding.\nIf your symptoms are not severe and your baby is not due for a while, you'll be monitored and, in some cases, kept in hospital for observation.\nHow long you need to stay in hospital depends on the\u00a0cause of the bleeding and how many weeks pregnant you are.\nBeing in hospital allows staff to keep an eye on you and your baby, so they can act quickly if there are further problems.\nFind out about common health problems in pregnancy\n\nVideo: What should I do if I start bleeding during early pregnancy?\n\nIn this video, a midwife tells you what to do if you start to bleed during early pregnancy.\n\nMedia last reviewed: 9 March 2023\n\nMedia review due: 9 March 2026\n\nPage last reviewed: 9 April 2024\n\nNext review due: 9 April 2027",

    "text": "How and when to take paracetamol for adults\n-\nBrand names: Disprol, Hedex, Medinol, Panadol\n\nParacetamol is available as tablets, capsules, syrup, powder and suppositories. Follow the instructions on the medicine packet.\n\nDosage and strength\n\nParacetamol comes as tablets, capsules, a syrup you swallow, a powder you add to water and a suppository. They come in different strengths:\ntablet \u2013 500mg, or 1g tablets only available if prescribed by a doctor\ncapsule \u2013 500mg\nsyrup you swallow (oral solution) \u2013 120mg, 250mg or 500mg in 5ml\npowder you add to water and drink\nsuppository (medicine that you push gently into your bottom) \u2013 60mg to 1g\nIf you're taking the syrup or powder, check the instructions for how much to take.\nThe usual dose for adults is either 500mg or 1g.\nIf you weigh less than 50kg (8 stone), check the maximum dose you can take with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nImportant\n\nAdults can take two 500mg tablets, 4 times in 24 hours. You must wait at least 4 hours between doses. The maximum is eight 500mg tablets in 24 hours. If you're taking 1g tablets, do not take more than four in 24 hours.\n\nHow to take it\nTablets or capsules\nSwallow paracetamol tablets or capsules with a drink of water. You can take it with or without food.\nSyrup\nParacetamol as syrup usually comes in a bottle with a cap that can be used to measure out the right dose. Do not use a kitchen spoon to take your medicine as this will not measure the right amount. Check the medicine packet for more information.\nPowder\nCheck that the sachet has not torn and is not already open. If it is, throw it away.\nEmpty 1 sachet of powder into a drink of water and stir well to dissolve before drinking.\nSuppositories\nGo to the toilet beforehand if you need to.\nWash your hands before and after using the medicine. Also clean around your anus with mild soap and water, rinse and pat dry.\nUnwrap the suppository.\nGently push the suppository into your anus with the pointed end first. It needs to go in about 3 centimetres (1 inch).\nSit or lie still for about 15 minutes. The suppository will melt inside your anus. This is normal.\nHow long to take it for\nIf you're taking paracetamol for a short-lived pain like a headache, you may only need to take it for a day or two.\nYou may need to take paracetamol for longer if you have a long-term health problem that causes pain.\nIt's safe to take paracetamol regularly for many years, as long as you do not take more than the recommended dose.\nIf you forget to take it\nIf you take paracetamol regularly and miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's within 4 hours of your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\nDo not take an extra dose to make up for a missed one.\nIf you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\nIf you take too much\nTaking 1 or 2 extra tablets is unlikely to harm you.\nBut taking too much paracetamol can be dangerous and you may need treatment. Too much paracetamol can cause liver damage.\nThe maximum number of tablets you should have in 24 hours is:\neight 500mg tablets\nfour 1g tablets if prescribed by a doctor\n\nUrgent advice:\nContact 111 for advice now if:\n\nyou take too much paracetamol, even if you feel well\nGo to\n111.nhs.uk\nor call\n111\n\nInformation:\n\nIf you need to go to\nA&E\n, do not drive. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nBring the paracetamol packet or leaflet inside it, any remaining medicine, and any other medicines you take.\n\nPage last reviewed: 20 October 2022\n\nNext review due: 20 October 2025",

This can result in a bulge in the bone rather than a complete break.\nThis injury is treated like a sprain and will not cause any long-term problems.\nTreatment\nBuckle fractures heal so well by themselves that you do not need any special treatment.\nA large scientific study that took place throughout the UK, called the FORCE study, investigated how best to treat these injuries. This study showed that children who were offered a bandage (which not all of them chose to wear) healed well and were equally as comfortable as those who were treated in a hard splint or cast.\nMost children start to use their wrist and hand comfortably again after a couple of weeks. They should be allowed to use the hand as much as they want, but shouldn\u2019t do anything that causes them pain or discomfort. If the child wears anything on their wrist (i.e. a bandage), then this should be removed whenever the wrist becomes more comfortable \u2013 and certainly by 3 weeks. When moving the wrist in the next few weeks they may complain of mild stiffness and aching. This is normal and should settle down quickly.\nYour child should be allowed to return to sporting activities, physical exercise and rough play as soon as the pain and discomfort settles.\nFollow up appointments\nWe should not need to see your child again.\nAll your X-rays will be reviewed by a specialist to check your child has been given the right treatment and ensure there are no other problems.

This is because of the size and weight of the vehicle and the length of time an occupational driver typically spends at the wheel.\n\nDrivers who were awarded a Group 1 category B (motor car) licence before 1 January 1997 have additional entitlement to categories C1 (medium-sized lorries, 3.5t to 7.5t) and D1 (minibuses, 9 to 16 seats, not for hire or reward). Drivers with this entitlement retain it only until their licence expires or it is revoked for medical reasons. On subsequent renewal or reapplication, the higher medical standards applicable to Group 2 will apply.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, volunteer drivers may drive a minibus of up to 16 seats without category D1 entitlement. DVLA outlines the rules for such circumstances on the GOV.UK website (see\nDriving a minibus\n).\n\nAge limits for licensing\n\nGroup 1\n\nLicences are normally valid until 70 years of age (the \u2019til 70 licence) unless restricted to a shorter duration for medical reasons.\n\nThere is no upper age limit to licensing, but after 70 renewal is required every 3 years.\n\nA person in receipt of the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) can hold a driving licence from 16 years of age. (A person can\u2019t apply for PIP until their 16th birthday.)\n\nGroup 2\n\nThe minimum age for Group 2 entitlement to drive lorries (category C) is 21 and for buses (category D) is 24, unless the driver is undergoing or has passed the Driver Certificate of Competence (CPC) initial qualification which they can do at the age of 21. The Group 2 licensing entitlement is valid for a maximum of 5 years. Group 2 licences must be renewed every 5 years or at age 45, whichever is the earlier, until the age of 65 when they are renewed annually without an upper age limit. Shorter licences may be issued for medical reasons.\n\nThere are exceptions, such as driving in the armed forces, and people of a minimum age of 18 can drive lorries and buses after gaining, or training towards, the Driver CPC.\n\nAll initial Group 2 licence applications require a medical assessment by a registered medical practitioner (recorded on the D4 form). The same assessment is required again at 45 years of age and on any subsequent reapplication.\n\nPolice, fire, ambulance and health service driver licensing\n\nThe same medical standards apply for drivers of police, fire, coastguard, ambulance and health service vehicles as they do for all drivers holding Group 1 and 2 licences. Any responsibility for determining higher medical standards, over and above these licensing requirements, rests with the individual force, service or other relevant body.\n\nTaxi licensing\n\nResponsibility for determining any higher standards and medical requirements for taxi drivers, over and above the driver licensing requirements, rests with Transport for London in the Metropolitan area, or the local council in all other areas.\n\nDecisions taken by employers on the use and application of the GB standards on fitness to drive in particular circumstances and as they relate to employees are for the employer to make. Any responsibility for determining higher medical standards, over and above these licensing requirements, rests with the individual force, service or other relevant body.\n\nInterpretation of GB legislation\n\nThe advice of the Honorary Medical Advisory Panels on the interpretation of GB legislation and its appropriate application is made within the context of driver licensing.\n\nSudden disabling events\n\nAnyone with a medical condition likely to cause a sudden disabling event at the wheel, or who is unable to control their vehicle safely for any other reason, must not drive.\n\nDVLA defines the risk of a sudden disabling event as:\n\n20% likelihood of an event in 1 year for Group 1 licensing\n\n2% likelihood of an event in 1 year for Group 2 licensing\n\nThese figures, while originally defined by older studies, have since been revalidated by more recent risk-of-harm calculations.\n\nDVLA notification by drivers or healthcare professionals\n\nApplicants and licence holders have a legal duty to:\n\nnotify DVLA of any injury or illness that would have a likely impact on safe driving ability (except some short-term conditions that are unlikely to continue beyond 3 months, as set out in this guide)\n\nrespond fully and accurately to any requests for information from either DVLA or healthcare professionals\n\ncomply with the requirements of the issued licence, including any periodic medical reviews indicated by DVLA\n\nThey should also adhere, with ongoing consideration of fitness to drive, to prescribed medical treatment, and to monitor and manage the condition and any adaptations.\n\nDoctors and other healthcare professionals should:\n\nadvise the individual on the impact of their medical condition for safe driving ability\n\nadvise the individual on their legal requirement to notify DVLA of any relevant condition\n\ntreat, manage and monitor the individual\u2019s condition with ongoing consideration of their fitness to drive\n\nnotify DVLA when fitness to drive requires notification but an individual cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves\n\nOf course, this last obligation on professionals may pose a challenge to issues of authorisation and the relationship between patient and healthcare professional. The General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Optical Council (GOC) offer guidance on this which is summarised below.\n\nIn law it is the duty of the licence holder or applicant to notify DVLA of any medical condition that may affect safe driving. This notification by people with licences issued by DVLA (because they live in England, Scotland or Wales) may be done via GOV.UK \u2013 see\nMedical conditions, disabilities and driving\n.\n\nFor people with licences issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland, the options for direct notification are given on the NI Direct page:\nHow to tell DVA about a medical condition\n.\n\nCircumstances may arise in which a person cannot or will not notify DVLA. It may be necessary for a doctor, optometrist or other healthcare professional to consider notifying DVLA under such circumstances if there is concern for road safety, which would be for both the individual and the wider public.\n\nThe General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Optical Council (GOC) offer clear guidance about notifying DVLA when the person cannot or will not exercise their own legal duty to do so.\n\nThe GMC guidelines 2017 (reproduced with permission) state:\n\n1.In our guidance Confidentiality: good practice in handling patient information we say:\n\n1.Trust is an essential part of the doctor-patient relationship and confidentiality is central to this. Patients may avoid seeking medical help, or may under-report symptoms, if they think that their personal information will be disclosed by doctors without consent, or without the chance to have some control over the timing or amount of information shared.\n\n60.Doctors owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients, but they also have a wider duty to protect and promote the health of patients and the public.\n\n62.You should ask for a patient\u2019s consent to disclose information for the protection of others unless it is not safe or practicable to do so, or the information is required by law. You should consider any reasons given for refusal.\n\n64.If it is not practicable to seek consent, and in exceptional cases where a patient has refused consent, disclosing personal information may be justified in the public interest if failure to do so may expose others to a risk of death or serious harm. The benefits to an individual or to society of the disclosure must outweigh both the patient\u2019s and the public interest in keeping the information confidential.\n\n68.If you consider that failure to disclose the information would leave individuals or society exposed to a risk so serious that it outweighs patients\u2019 and the public interest in maintaining confidentiality, you should disclose relevant information promptly to an appropriate person or authority. You should inform the patient before disclosing the information, if it is practicable and safe to do so, even if you intend to disclose without their consent.\n\nAbout this guidance\n\n2.Doctors owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients, but they also have a wider duty to protect and promote the health of patients and the public. This explanatory guidance sets out the steps doctors should take if a patient\u2019s failure or refusal to stop driving exposes others to a risk of death or serious harm.\n\nFitness to drive: doctors\u2019 and patients\u2019 responsibilities\n\n3.The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in England, Scotland and Wales and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland are legally responsible for deciding if a person is medically unfit to drive. This means they need to know if a person holding a driving licence has a condition or is undergoing treatment that may now, or in the future, affect their safety as a driver.\n\n4.The driver is legally responsible for telling the DVLA or DVA about any such condition or treatment. Doctors should therefore alert patients to conditions and treatments that might affect their ability to drive and remind them of their duty to tell the appropriate agency. Doctors may, however, need to make a decision about whether to disclose relevant information without consent to the DVLA or DVA in the public interest if a patient is unfit to drive but continues to do so.\n\nAssessing a patient\u2019s fitness to drive\n\n5.When diagnosing a patient\u2019s condition, or providing or arranging treatment, you should consider whether the condition or treatment may affect their ability to drive safely. You should:\n\nrefer to the DVLA\u2019s guidance Assessing fitness to drive \u2013 a guide for medical professionals, which includes information about disorders and conditions that can impair a patient\u2019s fitness to drive\n\nseek the advice of an experienced colleague or the DVLA\u2019s or DVA\u2019s medical adviser if you are not sure whether a condition or treatment might affect a patient\u2019s fitness to drive.\n\nReporting concerns to the DVLA or DVA\n\n6.If a patient has a condition or is undergoing treatment that could impair their fitness to drive, you should:\n\na. explain this to the patient and tell them that they have a legal duty to inform the DVLA or DVA\n\nb. tell the patient that you may be obliged to disclose relevant medical information about them, in confidence, to the DVLA or DVA if they continue to drive when they are not fit to do so\n\nc. make a note of any advice you have given to a patient about their fitness to drive in their medical record.\n\n7.If a patient is incapable of understanding this advice \u2013 for example, because of dementia \u2013 you should inform the DVLA or DVA as soon as practicable.\n\n8.If a patient refuses to accept the diagnosis, or the effect of the condition or treatment on their ability to drive, you can suggest that they seek a second opinion, and help arrange for them to do so. You should advise the patient not to drive in the meantime. As long as the patient agrees, you may discuss your concerns with their relatives, friends or carers.\n\n9.If you become aware that a patient is continuing to drive when they may not be fit to do so, you should make every reasonable effort to persuade them to stop. If you do not manage to persuade the patient to stop driving, or you discover that they are continuing to drive against your advice, you should consider whether the patient\u2019s refusal to stop driving leaves others exposed to a risk of death or serious harm. If you believe that it does, you should contact the DVLA or DVA promptly and disclose any relevant medical information, in confidence, to the medical adviser.\n\n10.Before contacting the DVLA or DVA, you should try to inform the patient of your intention to disclose personal information. If the patient objects to the disclosure, you should consider any reasons they give for objecting. If you decide to contact the DVLA or DVA, you should tell your patient in writing once you have done so, and make a note on the patient\u2019s record.\n\nResponding to requests for information from the DVLA or the DVA\n\n11.If you agree to prepare a report or complete or sign a document to assist the DVLA\u2019s or the DVA\u2019s assessment of a patient\u2019s fitness to drive, you should do so without unreasonable delay.\n\nSee the full guidance on the GMC website:\nConfidentiality: patients\u2019 fitness to drive and reporting concerns to the DVLA or DVA\n.\n\nThe GOC offers similar guidance, available in full at its website under the confidentiality section of its General Optical Council Standards (use the subsection on \u2018disclosing confidential information about patients with or without consent\u2019).\n\nThis guidance includes the following (reproduced with permission of GOC):\n\nDisclosing information with consent\n\nWhere you are not sharing information with other healthcare professionals for the purpose of providing (or supporting the provision of) direct care to a patient, you should always try to get your patient\u2019s explicit consent to disclose sensitive information about them, unless any of the following apply:\n\na. obtaining consent would defeat the purpose of the disclosure (for example, where there would be a risk of harm to others; where detection of a serious crime would be obstructed); or\n\nb. you have already made the decision to disclose information in the public interest and obtaining consent would be meaningless or tokenistic; or\n\nc. the patient is not able to give consent as a result of disability, illness or injury. A patient\u2019s ability to give consent is referred to as their \u2018capacity\u2019 to consent. For more information on capacity, including what to do if a patient lacks capacity, see our consent guidance.\n\nWhere your patient provides you with explicit consent to disclose confidential information about them, you must ensure that they know what they are consenting to (see Standards 2 and 3 of the Standards of Practice, and our consent guidance) and that they are clear what information is going to be disclosed, why it is being disclosed and to which person or authority. Where you are relying on implied consent (see paragraph 10 above), patients should not be surprised to learn how their information is used; if the information would be used in ways that patients would not reasonably expect, you should seek explicit consent for this from the patient.\n\nIt is important to remember that patients with the capacity to consent have the right to make their own decisions and to refuse consent, even where you or others may consider the decision to be ill-advised. If a patient makes a decision contrary to clinical advice, you should document this in the patient records so that it is clear to all involved in that patient\u2019s care.\n\nDisclosing information without consent\n\nIf a patient does not provide you with explicit consent to disclose confidential information about them, and if you cannot rely on implied consent, there may still be circumstances in which you may pass the information on to an appropriate authority, such as where it is in the public interest, or where there is a legal requirement for you to do so.\n\nNotification can be provided by healthcare professionals in the above circumstances, in confidence:\n\nBy email:\nmedadviser@dvla.gov.uk\n\nBy post:\n\nMedical Business Support\nD7 West\nDVLA\nSwansea\nSA6 7JL\n\nFor Northern Ireland\n\nPlease contact DVA.\n\nEmail:\nDVAUrgentMedical@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk\n\nPost:\n\nDrivers Medical Section\nDriver and Vehicle Agency\nCounty Hall\nCastlerock Road\nColeraine\nBT51 3TB\n\nHow DVLA responds to notification and applies the medical standards\n\nOnce DVLA is notified of a medical condition and obtains authorisation, it will make medical enquiries as required.\n\nThe Secretary of State (in practice, DVLA) is unable to make a licensing decision until all the relevant medical information is available and has been considered. Exceptions to this do exist, specifically DVLA\u2019s ability to revoke a licence immediately in the interests of road safety and without detailed enquiry if individual case circumstances dictate this.\n\nDVLA\u2019s medical enquiries procedure is generally a 2-stage process:\n\nInformation on the medical condition is sought from the licence holder or applicant, either by paper questionnaire or online\n\nInformation is sought from relevant healthcare professionals, either by questionnaire or provision of medical notes.\n\nIn some circumstances DVLA will require independent review by a DVLA-appointed doctor or optician/optometrist. Depending on individual circumstances, a licence applicant may also require a driving assessment and/or appraisal.\n\nDriving during medical enquiries\n\nThe time taken to obtain all necessary reports can be lengthy but a licence holder may retain entitlement to drive under Section 88 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. However, a driver whose last licence was revoked or refused because of a medical condition or is a high risk offender re-applying after a drink/drive disqualification from 1 June 2013 would not, however, be eligible to drive until they are issued with a new licence.\n\nThe driver may be covered to drive, but this carries implications for road safety in that the licence holder may continue to drive with a medical condition that, on completion of DVLA\u2019s enquiries, may ultimately result in licence withdrawal.\n\nIt is for the patient to assure themselves that they are fit to drive. Medical professionals who are asked for an opinion about a patient\u2019s fitness to drive in these circumstances should explain the likely outcome by reference to this guide. The final decision in relation to driver licensing will, however, rest with DVLA.\n\nBy reference to DVLA\u2019s guidance, the doctor in charge of an individual\u2019s care should be able to advise the driver whether or not it is safe for them to continue to drive during this period.\n\nPatients must be reminded that if they choose to ignore medical advice to stop driving this may affect the validity of their motor insurance cover. Doctors are advised to formally and clearly document the advice given.\n\nDVLA is solely reliant on doctors and other healthcare professionals for the provision of medical information. To make timely licensing decisions that impact on the safety of the individual and the public, DVLA needs information to be provided as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen DVLA holds all relevant information, a decision can then be made as to whether or not the driver or applicant satisfies the national medical guidelines and the requirements of the law. A licence is accordingly issued or refused/revoked.\n\nOutcome of medical enquiries\n\nDVLA does not routinely tell doctors of the outcome of a medical enquiry. Drivers are always informed of the outcome, either by being issued a licence or by notification of a refusal or revocation.\n\nFor cases in which the driver may not have the insight and/or memory function to abide by the refusal or revocation of their licence \u2013 for example, in cognitive impairment, dementia or a mental health condition \u2013 DVLA may, in exceptional circumstances, send a decision letter to the GP in line with prevailing legislation and GMC guidance on disclosures in the public interest.\n\nWhen a notification is received from a doctor in accordance with the GMC guidelines, unless relevant to one of these conditions affecting mental capacity, DVLA will send an acknowledgement letter only to the GP, to confirm receipt of the original notification.\n\nMedical notification form for use by healthcare professionals\n\nThe\nmedical notification form\nfor use when patients cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves is available, for use by healthcare professionals only, on GOV.UK. This form is only for patients living in England, Scotland or Wales who hold a driving licence issued by DVLA.\n\nThe completed form should be returned to:\n\nmedadviser@dvla.gov.uk\n\nOr by post:\n\nMedical Business Support\nD7 West\nDVLA\nSwansea\nSA6 7JL\n\nFor patients living in Northern Ireland who cannot or will not self-notify, please use these contact details.\n\nEmail:\nDVAUrgentMedical@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk\n\nPost:\n\nDrivers Medical Section\nDriver and Vehicle Agency\nCounty Hall\nCastlerock Road\nColeraine\nBT51 3TB\n\nPlease fill in all parts of DVLA\u2019s medical notification form in relation to the medical condition of your patient. Parts A and B are for your patient\u2019s and your own details, including your signed and dated declaration that all details are correct to the best of your knowledge.\n\nPart C of the form should be completed in all fields and providing as much detail as possible regarding your patient\u2019s medical condition. You may send clinic letters with this notification, to help provide details of your patient\u2019s medical condition or if you think it will aid the licensing decision.\n\nPlease note, your patient can request copies of any medical documents held at DVLA unless you specify in writing that releasing this information could cause serious harm to your patient.\n\nDVLA cannot be responsible for the payment of any fee associated with notification.\n\nObtaining advice from DVLA on fitness to drive\n\nContacting DVLA\u2019s doctors\n\nDoctors and other healthcare professionals are always welcome to write to or email one of DVLA\u2019s doctors.\n\nAdvice may be sought about a particular driver identified by a unique reference number, or about fitness to drive in general.\n\nThe contact details for such enquiries in England, Scotland and Wales are:\n\nmedadviser@dvla.gov.uk\n\nDrivers Medical Group\nDVLA\nSwansea\nSA99 1DA\n\nPlease note that this service is for medical professionals only.\n\nThe contact details for enquiries in Northern Ireland are below.\n\nEmail:\nDVAUrgentMedical@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk\n\nPost:\n\nDrivers Medical Section\nDriver and Vehicle Agency\nCounty Hall\nCastlerock Road\nColeraine\nBT51 3TB\n\nSeat belt use and exemption\n\nThe law makes it compulsory for car occupants to wear seatbelts where fixed. Exemption on medical grounds requires a valid exemption certificate to confirm that, in a medical practitioner\u2019s view, exemption is justified. Exemption will require careful consideration in view of extensive evidence for the safety implications of seatbelts in reducing casualty rates.\n\nView guidance leaflet\nMedical exemption from compulsory seat belt wearing\n.\n\nUpdates to this page\n\nPublished 11 March 2016\n\n September 2025\n\n+\nshow all updates\n\n26 September 2025\n\nAmendments to the contact details for DVA Northern Ireland.\n\n15 January 2024\n\nChanges to use of the word 'consent' \u2013 DVLA now refers to this as 'authorisation', after a recent law change.\n\nChanges to the section around outcomes of medical enquiries, to clarify for DPA purposes that DVLA does not routinely share outcomes with clinicians.\n\nRemoval of the telephony and fax options for medical professionals to contact the Drivers Medical department as these channels are no longer available.\n\n2 March 2021\n\nAddition of General Optical Council advice regarding \u201cDisclosing information with consent\u201d and \u201cDisclosing information without consent\u201d\n\n26 September 2019\n\nAge limits for licensing: Details of Group 2 entitlement have been clarified and updated.\n\n31 August 2018\n\nClarification of requirement to meet Group 2 standards on reapplication for C1/D1 entitlements.\n\n1 January 2018\n\nAmendments to advice for emergency (blue light) driver licensing and taxi driver licensing.\n\n22 June 2017\n\nInclusion of updated (April 2017) GMC guidance for doctors.\n\n18 April 2016\n\nChange to information under the headings age limits for licensing and driving during medical enquiries.\n\n11 March 2016\n\nFirst published.\n\nSign up for emails or print this page\n\nGet emails about this page\n\nPrint this page\n\nContents",

Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\nTo hide the taste of the liquid, you can give the child a drink of milk or fruit juice straight after the medicine. But do not mix ibuprofen liquid with juice or milk as it may mean they do not get the right dose if they do not finish the drink.\nTablets and capsules\nTablets and capsules should be swallowed whole with a drink of water or juice. Tell your child not to chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate their mouth or throat.\nChildren taking chewable capsules should chew them before swallowing.\nGranules\nSprinkle or stir the granules into a small amount of soft food (such as yoghurt) or a small drink, or you can mix them with a spoonful of cold water. Do not mix the granules with warm food or warm liquid.\nYour child should then swallow the food, or drink the liquid straight away without chewing. Make sure they take it all. Do not keep the granules and food mixture to give later.\n\nVideo: how to give medicine to a child using an oral syringe\n\nThis video describes how to give medicine to a child using an oral syringe.\n\nMedia last reviewed: 17 July 2025\n\nMedia review due: 17 July 2028\n\nHow long to give it for\nDo not give ibuprofen to a child aged 6 months or older for more than 3 days without speaking to a doctor.\nIf your baby is aged 3 to 5 months, or under 3 months and has been prescribed ibuprofen, speak to a doctor if they do not improve within 24 hours or their symptoms get worse.\nIf you forget to give it\nGive the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for their next dose.

In the hospital, diluted apple juice is often used. To make this, simply mix half apple juice and half water (50/50). Please give this between feeds or after each watery stool. Little and often works best \u2013 in hospital babies and young children are given 1 or 2 tablespoons (5-10ml) of apple juice to drink every 5-10 minutes. You can try using a syringe to give fluids to your child.\nContinue to offer your child their usual feeds, including breast and other milk feeds.\nDo not worry if your child is not interested in solid food. If they are hungry, offer them plain food such as biscuits, bread, pasta or rice. It is advisable not to give them fizzy drinks as this can make diarrhoea worse.\nYour child may have stomach cramps; if simple painkillers such as\nparacetamol\nand\nibuprofen\ndo not help please seek further advice.\nMost children with diarrhoea and / or vomiting get better very quickly, but some children can get worse. You need to regularly check your child and follow the advice given to you by your healthcare professional and / or as listed on this sheet\nAbout Gastroenteritis\nTummy bugs are extremely common in young children and are almost always caused by a virus.\nThey are easily spread, resulting in outbreaks in nurseries and schools.\nDiarrhoea can often last between 5 \u2013 7 days and stops within 2 weeks. Vomiting usually stops within 3 days. If your child continues to be ill for longer than these periods, seek advice.\nSevere diarrhoea and / or vomiting can lead to dehydration, which is when the body does not have enough water or the right balance of salts to carry out its normal functions. If the dehydration becomes severe it can be dangerous.\nChildren at increased risk of dehydration include:\nyoung babies under 1 year old (and especially the under 6 months)\nbabies born at a low birth weight and those who have stopped drinking or breastfeeding during the illness\nchildren with faltering growth\nAfter Care\nOnce your child is rehydrated and no longer vomiting:\ncontinue breastfeeding, other milk feeds and fluid intake - give full strength milk straight away.\nreintroduce the child\u2019s usual food.\navoid giving fizzy drinks until the diarrhoea has stopped\nif dehydration recurs, start giving ORS again\nanti-diarrhoeal medicines (also called antimotility drugs) should not be given to children\nyour child cannot return to nursery / school until 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea and / or vomiting\nPreventing the spread of Gastroenteritis (diarrhoea and / or vomiting):\nYour Child should:\nYou and/or your child should wash your hands with soap (liquid if possible) in warm running water and then dry them carefully:\nAfter going to the toilet\nAfter changing nappies\nBefore touching food\nYour child should not:\nShare his or her towels with anyone\nGo to school or any other childcare facility until 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea and / or vomiting\nSwim in swimming pools until 2 weeks after the diarrhoea has stopped\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

    "text": "What is concussion? \nConcussion is a traumatic brain injury  which is often caused by a bump, blow \nor jolt to the head and affects the way the brain normally works. It can occur \nfrom a fall or blow to the body which causes the head and brain to move \nquickly back and forth. Concussion can happen anywhere, for example during \nsports, in the playground, or at home and must always be taken seriously. \nIf a child or young person is thought to have concussion they should \nimmediately stop whatever activity they are doing and be assessed by a \nmedical professional for a diagnosis and guidance. A second concussion can \nbe extremely serious. Each concussion is different and not everyone reacts \nin the same way. The key to a good recovery is physical and mental rest, \nfollowed by a gradual return-to-school (RTS), physical activity, and sport.\nConcussion symptoms \nConcussion can resolve within a few days \nor weeks. For some students the symptoms \nof concussion can linger and have the \npotential to cause longer term academic \nand social difficulties. In the short and long-\nterm, concussion symptoms can also have \na significant impact on classroom learning \nand schoolwork ( see symptoms right ).Cognitive\n\u2022 Feeling mentally foggy\n\u2022 Fatigue\n\u2022 Feeling slowed down\n\u2022 Difficulty concentrating\n\u2022 Difficulty remembering\n\u2022 Difficulty focussing\nSleep\n\u2022 Difficulty falling asleep\n\u2022 Sleeping more than usual\n\u2022 Sleeping less than usual\n\u2022 Drowsy\n\u2022 Altered sleep schedulePhysical\n\u2022 Headache\n\u2022 Dizziness\n\u2022 Balance difficulties\n\u2022 Nausea and vomiting\n\u2022 Fatigue \n\u2022 Sensitivity to light and noise\n\u2022 Visual problems\nEmotional \nand Behavioural\n\u2022 Irritability\n\u2022 Sadness\n\u2022 Nervous/anxious\n\u2022 Frustration\n\u2022 Anger\n\u2022 More emotional than usual\nWhen can the student RTS and \nresume normal activities? \nA period of immediate rest is important  \nafter a concussion. However, prolonged \nabsence from school is not recommended \nbecause it can be associated with \nincreased symptoms and may be \ndetrimental to recovery1. The RTS guidance \noverleaf allows the student to participate \nand learn without worsening their symptoms. \nTeachers should monitor the student \ncarefully and consider what adjustments \nmay be required (see examples right).Examples of support for the student\u2019s RTS\n\u2022  Initially reduce class time  \ne.g., later start time and/or \nshortened day\n\u2022  Allow student to avoid crowded \nand noisy environments e.g., \nlunch hall or corridors\n\u2022  Consider providing  \nemotional support \n\u2022  Provide opportunities for \nrepetition and review\n\u2022  Allow more time to  \ncomplete work\u2022  Permit the use of headphones or \nsunglasses if student is sound or \nlight sensitive\n\u2022  Provide a quiet workspace and/\nor rest breaks during lessons\n\u2022  Increase physical activity \ngradually, and follow guidance \nregarding engagement in PE\n\u2022  Provide reassurance\n\u2022  Remain flexible to fluctuating \nneeds and be prepared to scale \nback if necessary\nCONCUSSION  \nRETURN-TO-SCHOOL GUIDANCEN-ABLES\nThe National Acquired Brain Injury\nin Learning and Education Syndicate\nKey facts \n  All concussions are serious\n  Most concussions \noccur without loss of \nconsciousness\n  Recognising concussion \nwhen it first occurs and \ntreating it correctly \ncan help recovery and \nprevent further injury\nFor further information about supporting a student with concussion in school go to: \nhttps://www.thechildrenstrust.org.uk/brain-injury-information/info-and-advice/what-is-acquired-brain-injury/concussion-in-\nchildren-and-young-people\nhttps://childbraininjurytrust.org.uk/how-we-help/cbit-in-hand/\nSymptoms of\nconcussion \nRed flags: Get medical help immediately if \nthe student has any \u2018red flag\u2019 or worsening \nsymptoms such as neck pain, repeated \nvomiting, increased confusion, seizures, and \nweakness or tingling in their arms or legs. \nThese may be signs of a more serious injury.\nStep by step return-to-school guidance following concussion\n(This is for guidance only and does not replace medical advice.

    "text": "Febrile seizures\n\nA febrile seizure (febrile convulsion or fit) can sometimes happen when a child has a high temperature. It's not usually serious, but it's important to get medical help if your child has a seizure.\nA febrile seizure can seem frightening, but it's unlikely to harm your child or cause long-term effects.\n\nCheck if it's a febrile seizure\n\nA febrile seizure can happen when a child has a\nhigh temperature (fever)\n.\nYour child may:\nbecome stiff and twitch, shake, or have jerking movements\nbecome unconscious\nnot respond or look at you when you talk to them\nbe sick or pee (wet themselves)\nbe sleepy, irritable or confused for up to 1 hour afterwards\nFebrile seizures usually last for 2 to 3 minutes. It's rare for them to last more than 10 minutes.\nThey usually affect children between 6 months and 6 years old.\n\nImmediate action required:\nCall 999 or go to A&E if your child:\n\nhas a seizure for the first time\nhas a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes\nis having difficulty breathing\nhas stiffness and twitching on only 1 side of their body\nis more sleepy than usual for more than 1 hour after the seizure stops\nhas more than 1 seizure within 24 hours\nDo not take your child to A&E if they are still having a seizure or are unconscious, call 999 instead.\n\nInformation:\n\nDo not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nBring any medicines you take with you.\n\nWhat to do if your child is having a febrile seizure\n\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, it's important to keep them safe while you wait for medical help.\n\nDo\n\ncheck the time the seizure starts and ends\n\nprotect their head with your hands or something soft\n\nremove any dangerous objects that are nearby\n\nafter the seizure ends, put your child in the\nrecovery position\nand make sure there is nothing in their mouth or throat that might affect their breathing\n\nDon\u2019t\n\ndo not move your child or try to hold them in place\n\ndo not put anything in your child's mouth\n\ndo not try to lower your child's temperature by undressing them or sponging them with cold water\n\nInformation:\n\nFind out how to put a baby in the recovery position on the St John Ambulance website\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures\n\nMost febrile seizures do not need treatment. But your child will need to be checked in hospital after having a febrile seizure for the first time. They may also need to stay in hospital for a short time.\nYour child may need some tests, including:\nblood tests\npee (urine) test\na lumbar puncture\n\u2013 where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses\nIf an infection is causing your child's high temperature, they may need medicine to treat it.\nTreatment for recurrent febrile seizures\nVery rarely, a child may keep having febrile seizures.\nIf this happens, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to give to your child while they're having a seizure. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to use it.\n\nPreventing febrile seizures\n\nYou cannot prevent febrile seizures. They can sometimes happen when your child has an infection and a high temperature.\n\nInformation:\n\nFebrile seizures and epilepsy\nFebrile seizures are not the same thing as\nepilepsy\n.\nChildren who have had a febrile seizure have a slightly increased chance of having epilepsy later in life, but this is rare.\n\nPage last reviewed: 21 June 2023\n\nNext review due: 21 June 2026",

However, remember this might not stop them having a further febrile convulsion and fever is a natural response to infection. Always follow instructions on the bottle and do not exceed daily maximum doses. Never give your child aspirin.\nTepid sponging is not recommended \u2013 it does not reduce fever and may cause your child discomfort.\nFebrile Convulsions (febrile seizures)\nFebrile convulsions occurs in some children with a high temperature (fever). Although it can be extremely scary the first time you see your child have one, most of the time they are not serious. Most occur with common illnesses such as ear infections, colds and other viral infections. Full recovery with no permanent damage is usual. The main treatment is aimed at the illness that caused the fever.\nWho gets them?\nThey occur in about 1 in 20 children, most commonly between 6 months and 6 years of age\nThey often occur on the first day of an illness associated with fever. There appears to be no connection between how high a child\u2019s fever is and whether they have a fit. \u00a0They can occur even with mild fevers\nMost children will not have another fit during the same illness\n1 in 3 children who have a febrile convulsion may go on to have further febrile convulsions in the future. This is more likely if other members of the family have had febrile convulsions.\nFebrile convulsions are not epilepsy. Regular treatment for prevention of future fits is usually not necessary. There is a small risk of your child developing epilepsy in the future and many parents worry about this, however, most children who have childhood simple febrile convulsions grow out of them and do not develop epilepsy\nIf your child has had a previous febrile convulsion, has a clear cause for their fever, their seizure stops quickly and they are back to normal soon after, they may be cared for at home. The first time your child has a fit, you should go to your local Emergency Department or call an ambulance\nOnce they have been examined, if a cause is found and your child is well, it may be appropriate that they are discharged to continue recovering at home\nWhat should you do?\nWhen the fit stops, you can give them\nParacetamol\nor\nIbuprofen\n. However, this might not stop them having another one. Always follow instructions on the container and do not exceed daily maximum doses\nFor more information on fever please see our page\nhere\n.\nHow long will the symptoms last?\nIn most cases, children with simple febrile convulsions appear dazed and their eyes may roll back\nTheir bodies may go stiff, their arms and legs may twitch or shake and they will become unresponsive for a few seconds. It is unusual for the febrile convulsion to last for more than 5 minutes\nYour child may be sleepy for a few minutes afterwards\nOccur in about 1 in 20 children, most commonly between 6 months \u2013 3 years of age.\nThey often occur on the first day of a febrile illness. There appears to be no connection between the extent of the fever and convulsions, so they can occur even with mild fevers.\nSimple febrile convulsions generally last less than 5 minutes, involve the whole body becoming stiff then jerking of all 4 limbs (a tonic clonic seizure) and the child may be sleepy afterwards but should return to their normal self within a couple of hours.\n1 in 3 children who have febrile convulsions may have further convulsions with febrile illnesses in the future.\nRegular treatment for prevention of future seizures is usually not necessary. Febrile convulsions are not epilepsy. There is a small risk of your child developing epilepsy in the future and many parents worry about this, however, most children who have childhood simple febrile convulsions grow out of them and do not develop epilepsy.\nIf your child has had a simple febrile convulsion, has a clear infection source that is causing their fever and you and the medical team are happy, they may be cared for at home.\nWhat to do if your child has another convulsion:\nPlace them in the recovery position \u2013 on their side, on a soft surface with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit and keep their airway protected.\nStay with your child and try to jot down what time their seizure starts and stops.\nDo not put anything in your child\u2019s mouth.\nIf the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes seek immediate medical help \u2013 call 999 or go to the nearest A&E.\nIf the seizure lasts less than 5 minutes \u2013 phone your GP or NHS 111 for advice if you\u2019re worried.\nIf you child appears to have a seizure(s) in the absence of fever, then please seek an urgent review with your GP. It is often extremely helpful if you or a family member are able to take a short video of your child when they are having their seizure.\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

    "text": "What to do if someone has a seizure (fit)\n\nIf you see someone having a seizure or fit, there are some simple things you can do to help.\nIt might be scary to witness, but do not panic.\nIf you're with someone having a seizure:\nonly move them if they're in danger, such as near a busy road or hot cooker\ncushion their head if they're on the ground\nloosen any tight clothing around their neck, such as a collar or tie, to aid breathing\nturn them on to their side after their convulsions stop \u2013 read more about the\nrecovery position\nstay with them and talk to them calmly until they recover\nnote the time the seizure starts and finishes\nIf the person is in a wheelchair, put the brakes on and leave any seatbelt or harness on. Support them gently and cushion their head, but do not try to move them.\nDo not put anything in their mouth, including your fingers. They should not have any food or drink until they have fully recovered.\n\nWhen to call an ambulance\n\nCall 999 and ask for an ambulance if:\nit's the first time someone has had a seizure\nthe seizure lasts longer than is usual for them\nthe seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, if you do not know how long their seizures usually last\nthe person does not regain full consciousness, or has several seizures without regaining consciousness\nthe person is seriously injured during the seizure\nthe person has difficulty breathing after the seizure\nPeople with epilepsy do not always need an ambulance or to go to hospital every time they have a seizure.\nThey usually have a care plan agreed with doctors and their family or carers that says what to do when they have a seizure, such as giving emergency medicine. If you know what to do and have been trained then you can follow their care plan.\nSome people with\nepilepsy\nwear a special bracelet or carry a card to let medical professionals and anyone witnessing a seizure know they have epilepsy.\nEpilepsy Action has more information about seizures that last longer than 5 minutes\n.\n\nMake a note of any useful information\n\nIf you see someone having a seizure, you may notice things that could be useful for the person or their doctor to know:\nWhat were they doing before the seizure?\nDid the person mention any unusual sensations, such as an odd smell or taste?\nDid you notice any mood change, such as excitement, anxiety or anger?\nWhat brought your attention to the seizure? Was it a noise, such as the person falling over, or body movements, such as their eyes rolling or head turning?\nDid the seizure happen without warning?\nWas there any loss of consciousness or altered awareness?\nDid the person's colour change? For example, did they become paler than usual, flushed, blue or grey? If so, where \u2013 the face, lips or hands? On brown or black skin, changes in colour may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids.\nDid any parts of their body stiffen, jerk or twitch? If so, which parts?\nDid the person's breathing change?\nDid they perform any actions, such as mumble, wander about or fumble with clothing?\nHow long did the seizure last?\nDid the person lose control of their bladder or bowel?\nDid they bite their tongue?\nHow were they after the seizure?\nDid they need to sleep? If so, for how long?\nThe\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) also has useful leaflets you can download about a first seizure without a fever in children and young people\n.\n\nKeeping a seizure diary\n\nIf you have epilepsy, it can be helpful to record the details of your seizures in a diary.\nRead more about seizure diaries and download one for free from:\nEpilepsy Action: keeping a seizure diary\nEpilepsy Society: seizure diaries\n\nPage last reviewed: 19 December 2023\n\nNext review due: 19 December 2026",

Seek help if they develop, as this may suggest a more severe illness requiring specific investigations and treatment.\nKeep your child as comfortable as possible. Consider giving\nparacetamol\nor\nibuprofen\nfor comfort.\nOffer them simple food and regular drinks.\nIf they are vomiting, offer small frequent drinks as this is more likely to stay down.\nDo not try to control your child\u2019s temperature with tepid sponging or fans.\nKeep an eye on your child day and night and follow the guidance overleaf. If a rash appears do \u201cthe glass test\u201d (see guidance overleaf).\nIf your child is due their vaccinations, postpone until after their fever has improved.\nNotify their school if you need to keep your child away while they are unwell and have a fever \u2013 see\nHealthier Together website\nfor advice if you are unsure whether they need to be kept off school or not.\nAbout fever in children\nMost children with a fever do get better very quickly but some children can get worse. You need to regularly check your child during the day and also through the night and follow the advice given below.\nFever is extremely common in children and usually suggests that your child has an infection.\nYour child has a fever if their temperature is over 38\u00b0C. The most accurate way of measuring your child\u2019s temperature is with a digital thermometer.\nViral infections are far more common than bacterial infections. Symptoms such as runny nose, cough, wheeze, sore throat, red eyes and diarrhoea are more suggestive of a viral infection than a bacterial infection. If a number of people are unwell in the same household, this also suggests a viral infection.\nViral infections tend to get better on their own and do not need treatment with antibiotics.\nDuring a viral illness we would expect to see ongoing temperatures for 2-3 days and then a slow and gradual improvement of symptoms. If your child becomes more unwell after a period of initial improvement, then seek medical input.\nUsing medicines to help\nIf your child is distressed you should consider giving them paracetamol or ibuprofen to help them feel more comfortable. Use one and if your child has not improved 2-3 hours later you may want to try giving the other medicine.\nCarefully read the instructions on the medicine for dose and frequency.\nYou could ask your local pharmacist for more advice about medicines.\nIn general, we do not recommend cough medicines.\nThe Glass Test\nDo the \u2018glass test\u2019 if your child has a rash. Press a glass tumbler firmly against the rash. If you can see the spots through the glass and they do not fade as you press the glass onto the skin then this is called a \u2018non-blanching rash\u2019. If you see this type of rash, seek medical advice immediately. The rash is harder to see on dark skin so check paler areas, such as palms of the hands, soles of the feet and tummy.\n(Photo courtesy of the Meningitis Research Foundation 2013)\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

    "text": "Constipation in children\n\nConstipation is common in childhood, particularly when children are being potty trained at around 2 to 3 years old.\n\nSymptoms\u00a0of constipation in children\nYour child may be constipated if:\nthey have done less than 3 poos in the last week\ntheir poo is large and hard\ntheir\u00a0poo looks like \"rabbit droppings\" or little pellets\nthey are straining or in pain when they poo\nthey have some bleeding during or after having a poo, because their poo is large and hard\nthey have a poor appetite or stomach pain that improves after they poo\nIf your child is over 1 year old, soiled pants can be another sign of constipation, as\u00a0runny poo (diarrhoea) may leak out around the hard, constipated poo. This is called overflow soiling.\n\nCauses of constipation in children\nConstipation in children has many possible causes. Sometimes there's no obvious reason.\nSome of the possible causes include:\nnot eating enough\nhigh-fibre foods\nlike fruit and veg\nnot drinking enough fluids\nfeeling pressured or being regularly interrupted while potty (or toilet) training\nfeeling worried or anxious about something \u2013 such as moving house, the arrival of a new baby, or starting nursery or school\nIf your child is constipated they may find it painful to poo, which may mean they do not want to try to poo. This can create a vicious circle; the more they hold back, the more constipated they get.\n\nHow\u00a0to treat your child's constipation\nIf you think your child may be constipated, take them\u00a0to a GP. The treatment for constipation depends on your child's age.\nThe longer your child is constipated, the more difficult it can be for them to get back to normal, so make sure you get help early.\nLaxatives\nare often recommended for children who are eating solid foods, alongside diet and lifestyle changes.\nIt may take several months for the treatments to work, but keep trying until they do. Remember that laxative treatment may make your child's overflow soiling worse before it gets better.\nOnce your child's constipation has been dealt with, it's important to stop it coming back. A GP may advise that your child keeps taking laxatives for a while to make sure their poo stays soft enough to push out regularly.\nTreating constipation with soiling (children pooing their pants)\nGetting constipated and soiling their clothes is not something your child is doing on purpose, so there's no reason to get cross with them.\nYou may both find the situation stressful, but staying calm and relaxed is the best attitude to help your child deal with the problem.\nA health visitor or GP can offer helpful tips.\nRead about\nsoiling (children pooing their pants)\n.\n\nHow to prevent\u00a0constipation\nMake sure your child has plenty to drink\n\u2013\u00a0offer breastfed babies who are not eating solids yet plenty of breastfeeds. Formula-fed babies can have extra drinks of water between their formula feeds. This must be cooled boiled water for babies under 6 months. See more advice on\ndrinks for babies and young children\n.\nGive your child a variety of foods\n, including plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are a good source of fibre. See\nwhat to feed young children\n.\nEncourage your child to be physically active\n. For more information, read the\nphysical activity guidelines for children aged under 5 years\n.\nGet your child into a routine of regularly sitting on the potty or toilet\n, after meals or before bed, and praise them whether or not they poo. This is particularly important for potty-trained boys, who may forget about pooing once they are weeing standing up.\nMake sure your child can rest their feet flat on the floor or a step when they're using the potty or toilet\n, to get them in a good position for pooing.\nAsk if they feel worried about using the potty or toilet\n\u2013 some children do not want to poo in certain situations, such as at nursery or school.\nStay calm and reassuring\n, so that your child does not see going to the toilet as a stressful situation \u2013 you want your child to see pooing as a normal part of life, not something to be ashamed of.\nIf you'd like advice\u00a0about taking the stress out of going to the toilet for your child, speak to a health visitor.\nFind out more advice for children with constipation on ERIC, The Children's Bowel and Bladder Charity website\n\nMore\u00a0information and support\nERIC, The Children's Bowel & Bladder Charity\n, is a UK charity for families affected by bedwetting, daytime wetting, constipation and soiling.

Even if pooing isn't painful, once your child is really constipated they may try to avoid going to the toilet altogether.\nWhy do Children get Constipated?\nYour child may be constipated because they:\nAren't eating enough\nhigh-fibre foods\nlike fruit and veg\nAren't drinking enough\nAre having problems with\npotty (or toilet) training\nAre worried or anxious about something, such as moving house, starting nursery or the arrival of a new baby\nFor further information and support see\nERIC's guide\nto children's bowel problems.\nPreventing your child from getting Constipated\nMake sure your child has plenty to drink. Offer breastfed babies who aren\u2019t eating solids yet plenty of breastfeeds. Formula fed babies can have extra drinks of water between their formula feeds. See more advice on\ndrinks for babies and toddlers.\nGive your child a variety of foods including plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are a good source of fibre. See what to\nfeed young children\n.\nEncourage your child to be physically active. For more information, read the\nphysical activity guidelines\nfor children aged under 5 years.\nGet your child into a routine of regularly sitting on the potty or toilet after meals or before bed (for 5 minutes). Praise them whether or not they poo. This is particularly important for boys who may forget about pooing once they are weeing standing up. Reward schemes appropriate for age are important; as is consistency and patience.\nMake sure your child can rest their feet flat on the floor or on a step when they're using the potty or toilet to get them in a good position for pooing. Take a look at this leaflet for a picture of how to\nsit to get the poo in the loo\n!\nAsk if they feel worried about using the potty or toilet. Some children don't want to poo in certain situations, such as at nursery or school.\nStay positive and reassuring, so that your child doesn't see going to the toilet as a stressful situation. You want your child to see pooing as a normal part of life, not something to be ashamed of.\nWhen should you worry?\n12-18 months\n12-18 MONTHS\nContact your health visitor or GP if your baby is 12-18

Getting constipated and soiling their clothes isn't something your child is doing on purpose, so there's no reason to get cross with them. Staying positive and relaxed is the best attitude to help your child and praising positive steps is important.\nIf your child is potty training, they may be feeling anxious or stressed about using the toilet. This can cause them to hold in their poo and lead to constipation. Give your child plenty of time to use the toilet while they are still learning. Encourage them when they do use the toilet. Some parents find a reward chart works. If you think your child is having difficulty with toilet training, you can also chat to your health visitor.\nIf your child remains constipated despite the advice above, speak to their GP who can decide if they need medicines. The treatment for constipation depends on your child\u2019s age. The longer your child is constipated, the longer it can take to get back to normal. Make sure you get help early.\nIf your child develops new or more severe\ntummy ache\nplease see our page .\nLaxatives are often recommended for children, alongside diet and lifestyle changes.\nIt may take several months for the treatments to work. Keep trying until they do. Remember that laxative treatment may make your child's overflow soiling worse for a time before it gets better so consider the impact, for example on school trips.\nOnce your child's constipation has improved, it's important to stop it coming back. Your GP may advise that your child keeps taking laxatives for a while to make sure their poo stays soft enough to push out regularly. The medicines are safe and don\u2019t cause a lazy bowel.\nMore Information and Support:\nContact the ERIC helpline on 0808 1699 949 (free to call from mobile and landline), Monday to Thursday 10am to 2pm.\nERIC's guide to children's bowel problems\n.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bContact your local community pharmacist.

It starts with red bumps that become small, yellowish blisters affecting the whole body \u2013 including the mouth and genitals (which can be very painful). They then open before scabbing over. These are very itchy and can make your child miserable. They may have a temperature, a cough and a runny nose. Children are able to pass the virus to others from the day before the rash appears until the last spot has scabbed over.\nChickenpox rarely needs treatment, unless in a new-born baby, or in a child with a known weak immune system ( i.e. weakened immune system due to anti-cancer treatment, immunosuppressive treatment or genetic immunodeficiency).

    "text": "Bronchiolitis\n\nBronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.\n\nBronchiolitis is different from\nbronchitis\n, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.\n\nSymptoms of bronchiolitis\n\nThe early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.\nA child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:\nbreathing more quickly\nfinding it difficult to feed or eat\nnoisy breathing (wheezing)\nbecoming irritable\nSymptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.\n\nImmediate action required:\nCall 999 or go to A&E if:\n\nyour child is having difficulty breathing \u2013 you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs\nthere are pauses when your child breathes\nyour child's\nskin, tongue or lips are blue\nyour child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake\nAs a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.\n\nFind your nearest A&E\n\nInformation:\n\nDo not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nBring any medicines you take with you.\n\nUrgent advice:\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:\n\nyour child has had a cold and it's getting worse\nyour child is feeding or eating much less than normal\nyour child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other\nsigns of dehydration\nyour baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher\nyour baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty\nyour child is very tired or irritable\n\nTreatments for bronchiolitis\n\nThere's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.\nBut it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.\n\nDo\n\ngive\nchildren's paracetamol\nto babies and children over 2 months old or\nibuprofen\nto babies and children over 3 months old \u2013 but do not give aspirin to a child under 16\n\ntry using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked\n\nkeep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake \u2013 this will help them breathe more easily\n\nencourage your child to drink lots of fluids \u2013 try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice\n\nDon\u2019t\n\ndo not smoke around your child\n\ndo not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes\n\nPreventing bronchiolitis\n\nThere are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:\nwash your hands and your child's hands often\nwash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly\navoid sharing things like cutlery and cups\nuse disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them\nkeep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu \u2013 especially if they were born prematurely or have serious health conditions\nIt's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.\nRSV vaccination\nThe\nRSV vaccine\nhelps reduce the risk of a common infection called\nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\ncausing serious problems such as bronchiolitis.\nThe vaccine is available on the NHS from 28 weeks of pregnancy. This will help protect your baby for the first few months after they're born.\nIt's also offered to adults aged 75 to 79.\nChildren at risk of severe bronchiolitis\nSome children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.\nThis includes children who:\nwere born very prematurely\nhave a heart or lung condition\nhave a weakened immune system\nThese children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.\n\nCauses of bronchiolitis\n\nBronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually\nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\n.\nRSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children get it at least once before they're 2 years old.\nIt's not usually serious, but some babies and children have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis, particularly:\nbabies under 6 months old\nbabies and children who were born prematurely\nbabies and children with a weakened immune system, or long-term lung or heart conditions\n\nPage last reviewed: 13 April 2022\n\nNext review due: 13 April 2025",

Babies and children are often most poorly on day 5 of the illness then start to get better.\nKeep a close eye on your baby's breathing and feeding. If you have any new concerns, please look at our red/amber/green table again.\nIf your child is not feeding as normal, offer smaller feeds more often.\nChildren with bronchiolitis may have some distress and discomfort. You may wish to give either\nParacetamol\nor\nIbuprofen\nto make them feel better (Paracetamol can be given from 2 months of age). Please read and follow the instructions on the medicine container.\nBronchiolitis is caused by a virus so antibiotics generally don\u2019t help.\nKeep your baby\u2019s sleep surface flat. Do not incline, tilt or prop the mattress, cot or baby unless advised by a health care professional\nAvoid co-sleeping with your baby if they are unwell with bronchiolitis or a respiratory tract infection. For more information, see our\nsafe sleeping\npage.\nAvoid exposure to tobacco smoke which makes their breathing worse. Remember that smoke stays on your clothes even if you smoke outside.\nIf you would like help to give up smoking you can get information and advice from your local GP surgery or by calling the National Stop Smoking Helpline Tel: 0300 123 1044 from 7am to 11pm every day.\nWhat is Bronchiolitis?\nBronchiolitis is an infection that causes the small airways in your child\u2019s lungs to become swollen. This can make it more difficult for your child to breathe.\nBronchiolitis affects children under the age of 2. It is caused by a virus, often the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).\nThe number of children with RSV is usually highest in winter but bronchiolitis can happen at any time of year.\nBronchiolitis usually causes cold like symptoms and mild breathing difficulty. Breathing may be faster than normal as well as noisy and your child may not be able to take their usual amount of milk by breast or bottle.\nYour child may get a little worse each day until the 3rd or 4th day of their illness after which they are likely to start improving.\nMost children get better on their own. There are no medical treatments that speed up recovery from bronchiolitis. Many children will continue to cough for a few weeks afterwards.\nSome children, especially those under 6 weeks of age or young children with heart or lung problems, can develop worse breathing difficulty and may need to go to hospital for help supporting their breathing and feeding.\nHow long does Bronchiolitis last?\nBabies are usually unwell for 5 to 10 days. Most will get better within two weeks. If you are concerned that your baby is not getting better or starts to get worse again please look back through the assessment table and contact a health care professional if required.Babies may still have a cough for up to 4 weeks afterwards and this is completely normal\nYour child can go back to nursery as soon as you feel they are well enough. Bronchiolitis does not normally cause long term problems for your child\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

It can also cause difficulty breathing which can be frightening for both you and your child.\nWhat is croup?\nCroup (also called laryngotracheobronchitis) can be caused by several viruses which affect the airways including the voice box (larynx), windpipe (trachea) and lungs (the bronchi) causing them to swell and become narrower. It usually affects babies and young children between the ages of one and three years old. Some children have croup two or more times in their childhood.\nWhat are the symptoms of croup?\nYour child may have:\nA cough \u2013 the cough is usually harsh and barking. This \u2018croupy cough\u2019 is due to inflammation and swelling of the vocal cords in the voice box (larynx).\nNoisy breathing symptoms \u2013 the inflammation can narrow the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea) and cause an extra noise called a\nstridor\n. This noise is normally heard on breathing in.\nBreathing may become difficult if the narrowing becomes worse.\nOther symptoms \u2013 these may include a runny nose, hoarseness and a sore throat. Croup may follow a cold but can also appear without any earlier illness. Children may also experience a high temperature (fever), general aches and pains and be off of their food.\nThe symptoms of croup appear worse at night. They usually peak after one to three days and then improve.

This \u2018croupy cough\u2019 is due to inflammation and swelling of the vocal cords in the voice box (larynx).\nNoisy breathing symptoms \u2013 the inflammation can narrow the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea) and cause an extra noise called a\nstridor\n. This noise is normally heard on breathing in.\nBreathing may become difficult if the narrowing becomes worse.\nOther symptoms \u2013 these may include a runny nose, hoarseness and a sore throat. Croup may follow a cold but can also appear without any earlier illness. Children may also experience a high temperature (fever), general aches and pains and be off of their food.\nThe symptoms of croup appear worse at night. They usually peak after one to three days and then improve. A mild but irritating cough may persist for a further week or so.\nNo items found.\nWhen should you worry?\nRED\nIf your child has any of the following\nBreathing very fast or breathing that stops or pauses\nWorking hard to breathe,\ndrawing in of the muscles below the rib\nor unable to talk\nA harsh noise as they breathe in (\nstridor\n) present all of the time (even when they are not upset)\nDrooling more than normal and struggling to swallow their own spit\nBecomes pale, blue, mottled and/or unusually cold to touch\nDifficult to wake up, very sleepy or confused\nWeak, high-pitched, continuous cry or can\u2019t be settled\nHas a fit (seizure)\nIs under 3 months old with temperature more than 38\u00b0C or under 36\u00b0C (unless fever in the 48 hours following vaccinations and no other red or amber features)\nHas a rash that does not go away with pressure (the \u2018\nGlass Test\n\u2019)\nYou need urgent help.\nGo to the nearest Hospital Emergency (A&E) Department or phone 999.\nAMBER\nIf your child has any of the following:\nBreathing a bit faster than normal or working a bit harder to breathe\nA harsh noise as they breathe in (\nstridor\n)\nonly when upset\nDry skin, lips or tongue\nNot had a wee or wet nappy in last 8 hours\nPoor feeding in babies (less than half of their usual amount)\nIrritable (Unable to settle them with toys, TV, food or hugs even after their fever has come down)\nIs 3-6 months old with temperature 39\no\nC or above (unless fever in the 48 hours following vaccinations and no other red or amber features)\nTemperature of 38\no\nC or above for more than 5 days or shivering with fever (rigors)\nTemperature less than 36\u00b0C in those over 3 months\nGetting worse and I am still worried\nYou need to contact a doctor or nurse today.\nPlease ring your GP surgery or call NHS 111 - dial 111.\n\u200d\nAMBER\nGreen\nIf your child has none of the above\nWatch them closely for any change and look out for any red or amber symptoms\nAdditional advice\nis also available for families for help cope with crying in otherwise well babies\nIf your child has a long term condition or disability and you are worried please contact your regular team or follow any plans that they have given you.\nSelf care\nContinue providing your child\u2019s care at home.

    "text": "Scarlet fever\n\nScarlet fever is a contagious infection that mostly affects young children. It's easily treated with antibiotics.\n\nSymptoms of scarlet fever\n\nThe first signs of scarlet fever can be flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature, a sore throat and swollen neck glands (a large lump on the side of your neck).\nA rash appears 12 to 48 hours later. It looks like small, raised bumps and starts on the chest and tummy, then spreads. The rash makes your skin feel rough, like sandpaper.\n\nCredit:\nBIOPHOTO ASSOCIATES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/262529/view\n\nOn white skin the rash looks pink or red. On brown and black skin it might be harder to see a change in colour, but you can still feel the rash and see the raised bumps.\n\nCredit:\nDon't Forget The Bubbles\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/#!jig[1]/ML/938\n\nCredit:\nDon't Forget The Bubbles\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/#!jig[1]/ML/4664\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/\n\nA white coating also appears on the tongue. This peels, leaving the tongue red, swollen and covered in little bumps (called \"strawberry tongue\").\n\nCredit:\nSCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/262413/view\n\nCredit:\nDon't Forget The Bubbles\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/\nhttps://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/scarlet-fever/#!jig[1]/ML/4652\n\nThe rash does not appear on the face, but the cheeks can look red. The redness may be harder to see on brown and black skin.\n\nCredit:\nISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/101463/view\n\nSometimes the skin peels, like sunburn, as the rash fades.\nThe symptoms are the same for children and adults, although scarlet fever is less common in adults.\n\nNon-urgent advice:\nSee a GP if you or your child:\n\nhave scarlet fever symptoms\ndo not get better in a week (after seeing a GP)\nhave scarlet fever and chickenpox at the same time\nare ill again, weeks after scarlet fever got better \u2013 this can be a sign of a complication, such as\nrheumatic fever\nare feeling unwell and have been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever\nScarlet fever spreads very easily. Check with a GP before you go in. They may suggest a phone consultation.\n\nWhat happens at your appointment\n\nGPs can often diagnose scarlet fever by looking at your tongue and rash.\nSometimes they may:\nwipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat to test for bacteria\narrange a blood test\n\nTreating scarlet fever\n\nIf you have scarlet fever a GP will prescribe antibiotics. These will:\nhelp you get better quicker\nreduce the chance of a serious illness, such as\npneumonia\nmake it less likely that you'll pass the infection on to someone else\n\nImportant:\n\nTaking antibiotics\n\nKeep taking the antibiotics until they're finished, even if you feel better.\n\nThings you can do yourself to help scarlet fever\n\nWhile you're taking antibiotics from your GP, you can help relieve symptoms of scarlet fever by:\ndrinking cool fluids\neating soft foods if you have a sore throat\ntaking painkillers like paracetamol to bring down a high temperature (do not give aspirin to children under 16)\nusing calamine lotion or\nantihistamine\ntablets to ease itching\n\nHow long scarlet fever lasts\n\nScarlet fever lasts for around 1 week.\nYou can spread scarlet fever to other people until 24 hours after you take your 1st dose of antibiotics.\nIf you do not take antibiotics, you can spread the infection for 2 to 3 weeks after your symptoms start.\n\nImportant\n\nIf you or your child has scarlet fever, stay away from nursery, school or work for 24 hours after you take the 1st dose of antibiotics.\n\nComplications of scarlet fever\n\nScarlet fever can be a serious illness, but thanks to antibiotics, it's less common than it used to be and easier to treat.\nBut cases of scarlet fever have increased in recent years.\nComplications from scarlet fever are rare. They can happen during or in the weeks after the infection, and can include:\near infection\nthroat abscess\nsinusitis\npneumonia\nmeningitis\nrheumatic fever\nPregnancy advice\nThere's no evidence to suggest that getting scarlet fever during pregnancy will harm your baby.\nBut it can make you feel unwell, so it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has it.\nContact a GP if you get symptoms.\nMany of the antibiotics used for scarlet fever can be taken during pregnancy.\n\nHow to avoid spreading scarlet fever\n\nScarlet fever is very infectious and can easily spread to other people.\nThere are things you can do to reduce the chance of spreading scarlet fever.\n\nDo\n\nstay off nursery, school or work until 24 hours after you take the 1st dose of antibiotics\n\nwash your hands often with soap and water\n\nuse tissues to trap germs from coughs or sneezes\n\nbin used tissues as quickly as possible\n\nDon\u2019t\n\ndo not share cutlery, cups, towels, clothes, bedding or baths with anyone else\n\nPage last reviewed: 23 December 2024\n\nNext review due: 23 December 2027\n\nSome images provided by\nSkin Deep (Don't Forget The Bubbles)\n.",

They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.\nThis guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight.\nAdvice and Guidance\nSelf care and Prevention\nDoes your child need antibiotics?\nIf a healthcare professional thinks that your child has strep throat or scarlet fever, they will prescribe your child antibiotics. This reduces the chance of their infection becoming more severe but more importantly also stops them spreading the infection to others (after 24 hours of starting antibiotics), especially to people at higher risk of severe infections such as the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.\nMy child has been in close contact with someone with Strep A - do they need antibiotics?\nIf your child has been in close contact with a case of scarlet fever or strep throat, they do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless they are showing signs of infection (severe tonsillitis with fever in the absence of a runny nose or signs of scarlet fever). Only in exceptional circumstances will the local public health team recommend for an entire school class to be treated with antibiotics.\nMy child has been diagnosed with scarlet fever or strep throat and is on antibiotics - what do I need to look out for?\nYour child may continue to have a fever for a few days after starting antibiotics. Very rarely, Group A streptococcus can spread to other areas of the body (invasive group A strep), causing infections in the neck (tonsillar abscesses or lymph node abscesses), behind the ear (mastoiditis), chest infections (pneumonia), bone and joint infections (septic arthritis) or\nsepsis\n. Look at the red /amber /green information below to help identify if your child has features of invasive group A strep or other complications of Group A strep.\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

The skin on the top of the toe is pink. There's a large raised, round, light grey blister on the centre of the toe.\nNext to the large blister are two very small white blisters.\n\nIf you're not sure your child has hand, foot and mouth disease\nLook at other\nrashes in babies and children\n.\n\nHow to treat hand, foot and mouth disease yourself\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease usually gets better on its own in 7 to 10 days. You cannot take antibiotics or other medicines to cure it.\nTo help the symptoms:\ndrink cool fluids to soothe the mouth and prevent dehydration (but avoid acidic drinks, such as fruit juice)\neat soft foods like yoghurt and avoid hot, salty and spicy foods\ntake\nparacetamol\nor\nibuprofen\nto help ease a sore mouth or throat\nA pharmacist can help with hand, foot and mouth disease\nAsk a pharmacist for advice about treatments, such as mouth ulcer gels, sprays and mouthwashes, to relieve pain.\nThey can tell you which ones are suitable for children.\n\nFind a pharmacy\n\nNon-urgent advice:\nSee a GP if:\n\nsymptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease do not improve after 7 to 10 days\nyou're pregnant and get hand, foot and mouth disease\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be spread to other people.\nCheck with your GP surgery before going. They may suggest a phone consultation.\n\nUrgent advice:\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n\nyou or your child has a very high temperature, or feels hot, cold or shivery\nyou're worried about your child's hand, foot and mouth disease symptoms\nyour child has hand, foot and mouth disease and is peeing less than usual (they may be becoming dehydrated)\nYou can call 111 or\nget help from 111 online\n.\n\nHow to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once.\nYou can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start.\nTo reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:\nwash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too\nuse tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze\nbin used tissues as quickly as possible\ndo not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery\nwash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash\nStaying off school or nursery\nKeep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling too unwell to go.\nBut as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed.\nKeeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading.\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy\n\nAlthough there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease.\nThis is because getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it.\nSpeak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\nPage last reviewed: 10 May 2024\n\nNext review due: 10 May 2027",

It usually gets better in a few weeks and you can usually just rest at home until you feel better.\nHSP cannot spread to others, so:\nyour child can return to school or nursery when they feel well enough\nyou can go back to work as soon as you feel up to it\nTreatment to relieve your symptoms\nParacetamol\ncan help ease any pain.\nDo not take\nibuprofen\nwithout speaking to your doctor because it could harm your kidneys.\nRegular check-ups for kidney problems\nYou'll have regular check-ups for 6 to 12 months to check how well your kidneys are working.\nYou'll usually be asked to provide a sample of pee and have your blood pressure checked at each appointment. This may be done at home, at your GP surgery, or in hospital.\nTreatment in hospital\nYou may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys.\nIn hospital, you may be given strong medicines like\nsteroids\nto help ease your symptoms.\n\nRisks of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP)\n\nMost people with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment.\nBut sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months.\nThere's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged (\nchronic kidney disease\n). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups.\n\nImportant:\n\nGetting HSP again\n\nYou can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back.\n\nPage last reviewed: 18 October 2023\n\nNext review due: 18 October 2026\n\nSome images provided by\nSkin Deep (Don't Forget The Bubbles)\n.",

Vasculitis means inflammation to the blood vessels. Inflammation is the body\u2019s natural immune response to injury or infection, but in vasculitis, the body\u2019s immune system attacks healthy blood vessels. It is not fully understood what causes vasculitis, though it could be triggered by a prior infection.\nNo items found.\nWho gets it?\nHSP is a rare condition that usually affects children 2-10 years. It is not known why it affects some children and not others. It is not infectious.\nWhat does it cause?\nIt can cause:\nA rash that looks like reddish-purple spots or small bruises\nJoint pain and swelling\nTummy pain\nKidney problems\nHigh Blood Pressure\nThe\nmost common\npresentation is a rash with joint and/or tummy pain.\nHenoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) on legs white skin\nHenoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) on top of legs white skin\nHenoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) swelling joints brown skin\nWho gets it?\nHSP is a rare condition that usually affects children 2-10 years.

Paracetamol can be used for pain relief./ Ibuprofen should only be taken if advised by a health professional.\nAbout 1 in every 3 children with HSP, it can come back in the first couple of months, though this is often milder than the first presentation. Very rarely it can cause long-term kidney damage. Due to this, children require regular monitoring for 6 months. This involves checking urine samples with a dipstick and you should have been given advice about how and when to do this.\nWhat should I look out for?\nPlease reattend your local centre if your child were to have any of the below:\nVisible blood in wee\nBloody poos\nSevere tummy pain\nUrine dipstick shows 2+ or more of protein\nSelf care and Prevention\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.\nAdvice and Guidance\nSelf care and Prevention\nWhat should you do?\nKeep your child well hydrated by offering them lots to drink.\nMost children with coughs and colds do not require treatment with antibiotics.\nIf your child seems to be in pain or discomfort, you can give your child\nParacetamol\nor\nIbuprofen\n, following the instructions on the container.\nDo not give cough syrup. It is not recommended for children under 6 years. It can make children sleepy and does not help.\nTry using saline nose drops or spray if your baby has a blocked nose.\nFor children over 1 year, a spoon of honey (perhaps in a warm drink) half an hour before bed may help them to wake less often in the night.\nFor children over 2 years, vapour rubs (containing camphor, menthol and/or eucalyptus) may help children sleep better.\nHow long will your child's symptoms last?\nCoughs and colds can continue for weeks before they get better.\nOver the winter, children are likely to get one viral infection after another, which can make you think that they are never well. Things will get better in the summer months.\nHaving a cough for 2 or 3 weeks does not mean that your child needs antibiotics.\nChildren under 2 years of age with breathing difficulty may have\nbronchiolitis\n. This is a common condition that usually starts as a runny nose and cough, but their breathing may get worse over the next 2-3 days.\nIf your child has noisy breathing, they might have\ncroup\n.\nTreatment\nMost children with coughs/colds do no require treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics rarely speed up recovery and often cause side effects such as rash and diarrhoea. They will also promote the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria in your child.\n\u200d\nPrevention\nIt is not always easy to avoid catching these infections. However, good hygiene practices can prevent infections spreading\nWash your hands regularly and thoroughly\nUse a tissue when coughing or sneezing and put it in the bin\nAvoid sharing glasses or utensils with people who are unwell\nThis guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight.\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

That's because research has shown antibiotics make very little difference to how quickly your child gets better. If you think that your child has otitis externa, you should consider using 2% acetic acid ear drops (e.g. Earcalm), which is an effective treatment for otitis externa. These are available without a prescription from your pharmacist. If your child is still no better after a week of using acetic acid drops, they should see a GP who may consider starting them on antibiotic ear drops.\nIf your child has redness extending to the skin around the ear (cellulitis), go and see your GP as they may need treatment with oral antibiotics. In addition, if your child has any features of severe infection (amber or red features above), they will need to be urgently seen by a healthcare professional who may decide that your child may benefit from antibiotic treatment.\nYou can help relieve symptoms by:\nGiving your child\nparacetamol\nor\nibuprofen\nto help relieve pain\nEncourage your child to drink plenty of fluids\nPrevention\nIt is not possible to prevent ear infections; however, you can do things that may reduce your child's chances of developing the condition.\nAvoid cleaning your child's ears with cotton buds - this may damage and irritate the ear canal and also push wax further into the ear. Wax is designed to come out by itself.\nTry not to let soap or shampoo get into your child's ear canal.\nTry to keep your child's ears dry; if water gets in, tip it out. This can be extremely challenging in young children!\nEnsure your child is up-to-date with their immunisations\nAvoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking)\nThis guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight.\nAdditional information and support may be accessed through local organisations and services.

    "text": "What is depression?\n\nGoing through different emotions is part of life. While it can feel worrying, it\u2019s normal for a young person to have some down days. This can be part of growing up or a natural response to something that\u2019s happening in their life.\n\nIf your child or young person is feeling low, they may seem more flat, tearful or irritable. But usually, they'll start to feel better in a few days or week. You may also notice that their mood lifts after a small change in their life. For example, after resolving a fall-out with a friend or getting to the end of a stressful time at school.\n\nWhen a young person is feeling depressed, low feelings last longer. This can make it difficult to enjoy things they normally would. It can also start to affect everyday activities like school or work. When a young person is experiencing depression, it\u2019s often difficult to feel better without extra support.\n\nKnowing that your child or young person is feeling depressed can be really worrying. Remember that lots of young people go through this, get help and start to feel better. We\u2019re here to help you support them and find the right help when they need it.\n\nSymptoms of depression\n\nWhile every young person is different, these are some common signs of depression:\n\nfeeling down, sad or flat\n\nfeeling numb or empty\n\nbeing more irritable\n\navoiding friends, school or social situations\n\nnot wanting to do things they used to enjoy\n\nfeeling tired or not having any energy\n\nfinding it hard to concentrate\n\nfeeling negative about themselves\n\nfeeling hopeless about the future\n\nhaving physical symptoms like trouble sleeping or a change in their appetite\n\nwanting to\nself-harm\n\nexperiencing\nsuicidal thoughts\n\nIf your child or young person experiences one or two of these things, it does not necessarily mean they\u2019re struggling with depression. But if you\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s important to speak to a professional like a GP.\n\nHow can I help my child or young person ?\n\nGently check in with them\n\nIt can help to start with an \u2018I\u2019 phrase like, \u2018I\u2019ve noticed you seem kind of down at the moment, can we have a chat about it?\u2019. It can also help to start the conversation while you\u2019re doing an activity, like walking or driving somewhere together. This can take the pressure off and make it easier for them to open-up. You can find more tips on starting a conversation in our guide for parents and carers.\n\nStarting a conversation with your child\n\nListen and provide emotional support\n\nTry not to ask too many questions or come up with quick solutions. Focus on listening and showing you can see it from their perspective. Thank them for telling you about it, remembering that they\u2019ve taken a risk in opening-up. Let them know they can talk to you as often and for as long as they need to. Try not take it personally if you\u2019re on the receiving end of anger or frustration sometimes. Being more irritable can be part of feeling low, especially for children and young people.\n\nYou can find more tips for making your child or young person feel really listened to in our blog.\n\nHow to really listen to your child\n\nTry other things if they\u2019re finding it hard to talk\n\nYoung people often find it difficult to talk to their parents or carers about how they\u2019re feeling. They might not know what to say, feel uncomfortable or be worried about upsetting you. In this situation you can:\n\nTry another way of speaking to them, like texting, messaging or writing a letter.\n\nLet them know you\u2019ll be there when they\u2019re ready and reassure them that you want to hear how they\u2019re feeling.\n\nEncourage them to speak to someone else they trust. This could be a relative or family friend. They might like to read our young people\u2019s\nguide to reaching out\nto help them decide who this person is.\n\nEncourage them to\nspeak to a helpline\nby phone, chat, email or text.\n\nThink about what\u2019s making them feel this way\n\nSometimes, children and young people feel low or depressed in reaction to events happening in their life. It could be :\n\na problem with a friendship or family relationship\n\nbeing\nbullied\nor feeling left out at school\n\nfeeling lonely\n\nfeeling overwhelmed by schoolwork or the school environment\n\nstruggling with a change such as\ndivorce or separation\nin the family\n\nexperiencing\ngrief or loss\n\ngoing through a\ntrauma\n, including witnessing or experiencing\ndomestic violence or abuse\n\nCan your child or young person identify anything that\u2019s affecting them at the moment? Are there changes that could be made at home or school that would make things easier?\n\nHelp them with daily self-care activities\n\nThese things might sound simple, but they can have a big effect on our mood. They include:\n\neating regular healthy meals and drinking enough water\n\ngetting enough sleep and getting up a regular time\n\ndoing some movement or exercise\n\nspending quality time with loved ones\n\nbalancing screen time with other activities\n\nEncourage them to do things they enjoy\n\nIf they\u2019re feeling very low in energy, you might want to start with something simple like watching a film or TV programme together. Or you can build up to things slowly. For example, if they usually enjoy exercising or playing sport, see if you can go for a short walk together. They can also listen to music or podcasts while you\u2019re walking.\n\nWork with them to make a support plan\n\nThis is a list of the kinds of things that help when they\u2019re struggling. It might include:\n\na list of their \u2018support circle\u2019 - the people they trust and feel comfortable reaching out to\n\nthe type of support they would like from you\n\nactivities that help them feel better\n\nthe\nservices or helplines\nthey can reach out to\n\na list of the professionals they can speak to when they need help \u2013 this might be their GP, counsellor, teacher or CAMHS worker\n\nReassure them\n\nKeep letting them know that:\n\nyou love them\n\nyou\u2019re here for them\n\nthese feelings will not last forever\n\nyou can find support to help things feel better\n\nMy son had become disconnected from life, and from all those who loved him. ... If any mother out there is experiencing a similar situation, my advice would be, play the mother\u2019s card of unconditional love. It's not your fault, and you cannot control how your child is feeling, but you can have hope that love will win the war over depression.\n\nA mother\u2019s story of her son\u2019s depression\n\nGet more tips from parents\n\nTry to find situations where your child might be more open and willing to talk to you, such as in the car or on a walk.\n\nRemember your child is not you, and their outlook and experience may be different to yours\n\nAllow your child some privacy but be available for them if they need you.\n\nTry not to \u2018fix things\u2019 - sometimes you just need to be there to listen.\n\nSometimes the time when you least want to be there is the time you most need to be there.\n\nTry to find the things which might be causing pressure for your child, and find ways to remove them.\n\nYoung people's advice for someone going through depression:\n\nSpeak to your doctor or a trusted adult about how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nDon't be afraid to cry, especially if you're male \u2013 it helps to release emotions and you'll feel better afterwards.\n\nI\u2019ve found that identifying behaviours that are not beneficial to you \u2013 like endlessly scrolling through Instagram before bed and sleeping late \u2013 can be really helpful.\n\nTry to keep going outside, even if it\u2019s just a short walk, it can really help your mood to life.\n\nRealise that how you\u2019re feeling won\u2019t last forever and there\u2019s always something to look forward to.\n\nFinding professional support\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about your child or young person\u2019s mental health, get professional advice. If they are struggling with depression, they may need professional help to feel better. They may also benefit from a specific diagnosis or treatment.\n\nSpeaking to your GP\n\nSpeaking to your GP is usually the first step to accessing mental health services through the NHS. The GP can explore how your child or young person is feeling. They can also discuss the options around treatment and support. Depending on how much they\u2019re struggling, the GP may:\n\nsuggest local support services like counselling organisations\n\nprovide self-help resources\n\nrefer them for assessment and support such as therapy through your local NHS mental health service for young people, known as\nCAMHS\n\nprescribe medication such as antidepressants, if they\u2019re 18 or over\n\nMedication for children and young people\nA young person who is under 18 can only be prescribed medication by a doctor who specialises in children and young people\u2019s mental health. This type of doctor is called a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\nMedication should only be offered to someone who is under 18 alongside talking therapy or another treatment. If a young person is taking medication, they should be regularly contacted and reviewed by a health professional. This could be a GP, CAMHS professional or a psychiatrist.\n\nOur medication guide has more information about the types of medication your young person might be offered.\n\nMedication guides\n\nCounselling and therapy\n\nCounsellors and therapists can help your child or young person to make sense of how they\u2019re feeling. They can also support them to find ways of coping.\n\nIf your young person is 18 or older, they can refer themselves for free talking therapy with the NHS. They do not need to see a GP to do this. They can find their local service and refer themselves for therapy on the\nNHS website\n.\n\nYou can find out how to access counselling and therapy in our guide for parents and carers.\n\nCounselling and therapy\n\nSpeaking to their school\n\nIf your child or young person is struggling, it can help to be open with the school about what\u2019s going on. Depending on their age, it may be important to make sure they feel some control over the information that\u2019s shared about them. For example by asking them who they would feel most comfortable for you to speak to.\n\nSome schools provide a free counselling service to their students. Alongside this, schools may also offer:\n\nmentoring\n\npeer buddying\n\nclubs and activities\n\nadvice through the school nurse\n\nEngaging Jack in categorisation games - animal or Lord of the Rings alphabets, shape/colour-searching in a room, ten likes/dislikes about someone or something (usually his sister) - helped in situations when the storm clouds were gathering.\n\nSupporting your child\u2019s mental health: a father\u2019s perspective\n\nIf your child is having suicidal thoughts\n\nSome young people who are struggling with depression can experience feelings of no longer wanting to be alive or not being able to go on. This is known as experiencing \u2018suicidal thoughts\u2019. A young person can struggle with thoughts of suicide without acting on them. But suicidal thoughts can also develop into a plan or intention to attempt suicide. This means all suicidal thoughts should be taken seriously.\n\nIf your child or young person is experiencing suicidal thoughts, it can be incredibly distressing. We\u2019ve got lots of advice about how you can support them and where you can find help in our guide for parents and carers.\n\nIf they are having a mental health crisis and they need help now, find out who to contact on our\n\nurgent help page\n.\n\nMore on suicidal thoughts\n\nGet support from PAPYRUS\n\nThe\nPAPYRUS Hopeline\ncan support you if you\u2019re worried that your child or young person might be experiencing suicidal thoughts. Their advisors will explore your concerns and help you to support your young person\u2019s safety.\n\nLooking after yourself as a parent\n\nSupporting a young person who is struggling with depression can be incredibly worrying. It\u2019s completely understandable it\u2019s affecting your own wellbeing. And it\u2019s so important that you get the support you need too. This could include:\n\nAsking for help\n\nThis might look like asking someone to help with childcare so you can take a bit of time off. Or it might be meeting a trusted friend for an hour to talk things through.\n\nReaching out to other parents\n\nMany parents find it helpful to talk to others who have been through similar situations. This could be reaching out to a parent you already know, or your local parent and carer forum. Or you might be able to find a local parent group using the\nCharlie Waller Trust directory\n.\n\nAccessing support\n\nIf you need to, you can ask your GP about local services that provide support such as counselling or therapy. You can also access these services privately if it\u2019s an option for you. Sometimes it helps just having someone there to listen to what you\u2019re going through. If you need talk, you can call the Samaritans anytime on 116 123.\n\nLook after yourself, as well as your child.\n\nI found it a frightening time, and very tiring.\n\nSeeking help for ourselves is not an admission of guilt, but \u2018role-modelling\u2019 good mental health for our children.\n\nWith our to-do lists multiplying overnight, that much-needed \u2018me time\u2019 inevitably starts to slip further down the list.

    "text": "It\u2019s normal for teenagers and young adults to experiment, test boundaries and take some risks. Drinking alcohol and trying drugs is one of the ways in which some young people do this. It is common for teenagers to drink alcohol at some point. A smaller number of young people will try illegal drugs, or smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes (often called \u2018vaping\u2019).\n\nA teenager or young adult might drink alcohol or take drugs for different reasons. They might do it because:\n\nit makes them feel good in the moment\n\nit\u2019s a way of having fun or socialising\n\nthey are curious and want to test boundaries or try new things\n\nthey want to fit in with a social group or feel pressure to do it\n\nit makes them feel more confident\n\nthey want to distract from difficult thoughts or feelings\n\nAs a parent or carer, it\u2019s important to talk to your child or young person about drugs and alcohol. By doing this, you can help them to understand the risks and support them to make safe and healthy choices. In this guide, you\u2019ll find lots of tips to help you. You\u2019ll also find information about where you can get help if you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s alcohol or drug use.\n\nUnderstanding the law and the risks\n\nSome drugs, such as alcohol and nicotine, are legal for people who are 18 or older. Some drugs, such as cannabis and cocaine, are illegal for anyone of any age to have or use. You can find out more about the law around drugs and alcohol on the Government\u2019s website:\n\nhaving and using drugs\n\nalcohol and young people\n\nWhen someone takes drugs, there is always risk involved. Using alcohol or drugs affects our judgement and decision-making. This can increase the risk of getting into dangerous situations. There is also always a risk of poisoning, having a bad reaction, or drinking or taking too much.\n\nYou can find more information about the risks around drinking alcohol, smoking, vaping and taking illegal drugs on the Frank website. Frank also has\nadvice about staying safe from drink spiking\n.\n\nGo to the Frank website\n\nHow can drugs and alcohol affect mental health?\n\nDrugs and alcohol can have different effects on a young person\u2019s mental health. In the short-term, a young person\u2019s mood might change while they\u2019re drinking or taking drugs. They may feel happy, excited or relaxed. Or they may feel low, worried or on-edge. Afterwards, they might feel tired, anxious or a bit spaced-out.\n\nOver the longer-term, misusing drugs or alcohol can lead to serious mental health issues. Teenagers and young adults may be at greater risk of this because their brains are still developing. For example, some research shows that young people who use cannabis may be at greater risk of developing psychosis. You can find more information about the mental health risks associated with specific drugs on the\nFrank website\n.\n\nDrug and alcohol use can also be linked with mental health issues because:\n\nIt can make existing mental health issues feel worse.\n\nThis is because our emotions often feel more intense when we\u2019re drinking or taking drugs. We can also feel less able to cope in the hours or days afterwards. This can make issues like anxiety or depression harder to manage.\n\nIf someone is struggling, they may start to use drugs or alcohol to cope.\n\nDrinking or taking drugs can be a way of numbing or distracting from difficult feelings or thoughts. But while it might sometimes feel like this brings short-term relief, it can make the problem worse over the long-term.\n\nAlcohol and drugs may affect them differently if they\u2019re taking medication for their mental health.\n\nTaking drugs with certain medications comes with a risk of serious side effects. Encourage your young person to talk to the GP about this when their medication is prescribed, so they understand the risks. If you\u2019re worried about this, you can speak to the GP yourself. You can also find more information on our\nmedication pages\n.\n\nHow can I talk to my child about alcohol and drugs?\n\nHave conversations as part of everyday family life\n\nTry to normalise talking about drugs and alcohol in your family. This will help your children to know that they can come to you for information and support when they need it. Treat conversations as an ongoing dialogue, rather than a one-off \u2018big chat\u2019.\n\nIf your family's views around alcohol or drugs are connected to your faith or culture, you may want to include this in your discussions.\n\nTalk openly and honestly whenever they start asking questions\n\nMake it clear that it\u2019s okay for them to be curious and to have questions. Let them know you\u2019re happy to answer their questions. You can always tell them you\u2019ll find out the answer if they ask something you don\u2019t know.\n\nBe curious about what they know\n\nShow interest in their experience. Is alcohol talked about at school, or in their friendship group? What have they heard about alcohol and drugs? Do they know people who drink, or someone who\u2019s tried drugs? What do they think about this? How does it make them feel?\n\nBe clear about the risks without being judgemental\n\nExplain the risks to your child clearly. This is important for keeping them safe. It also helps them understand why you\u2019re worried about them drinking or trying drugs. They\u2019re more likely to listen if they know that it\u2019s coming from a place of care. Give examples of\nthe risks that come with different drugs\nand allow them time to respond to these.\n\nSet boundaries\n\nPut agreements in place around how your child is going to stay safe when they\u2019re going out with their friends. Always make it clear that they can call you if they get into a situation that feels unsafe.\n\nStay calm during conversations\n\nTry to do this even if your child or young person tells you something that worries you. Avoid getting angry, shouting, or telling them they\u2019re \u2018bad\u2019 for drinking or trying drugs. If they\u2019re worried that you will be cross, they might become secretive about what they\u2019re doing. Remember, you cannot help to keep them safe if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. If they do come to you, think together about what will help make sure they\u2019re safe.\n\nHow to start a conversation if you\u2019re concerned\n\nIt\u2019s important to look out for signs that your child\u2019s drinking or drug use is affecting their mental health or wellbeing. You can find a list of common warning signs further down this page.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried, start by gently checking in with them. It might help to do this while you\u2019re out on a walk or doing an activity together. This can help to make it feel like less of a \u2018big chat\u2019 and encourage them to open up. Use an \u2018I\u2019 phrase like, \u2018I\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve been drinking more when you go out with your friends, can we have a chat about it?\u2019\n\nSupporting your child to make safe and healthy decisions\n\nModel a healthy relationship with drugs and alcohol\n\nBefore they start thinking about drinking or trying drugs themselves, your child or young person will be learning from what they see you doing. Reflect on your own relationship with drugs or alcohol. What messages might you be sending to them?\n\nDo some research so you feel confident and informed\n\nThings change with each generation. It\u2019s helpful to know what words are used, what the most common drugs are, and where people are getting them. This will help you feel confident when you\u2019re talking about them and setting boundaries. The\nFrank website\nis a good place to start.\n\nSupport your child to deal with peer pressure\n\nSometimes, a young person might feel like there is pressure to drink or take drugs when they do not want to. Friends or peers might tell them to do it or make them feel bad if they don\u2019t. They might also feel under pressure to explain why they aren\u2019t joining in. This can be particularly difficult for teenagers and young people, because it\u2019s often a time when \u2018fitting in\u2019 feels really important.\n\nPeer pressure can leave someone feeling worried, alone and even unsafe. In this situation, make it clear that:\n\nthere are serious risks involved with drinking or trying drugs\n\nwhen it comes to drugs and alcohol, the only person who gets to decide what they do is them\n\nanyone who\u2019s making them feel this way is not being a good friend\n\npeople who care about us should not push us to do things we\u2019re uncomfortable about\n\nsomeone often pressures people to do things when they\u2019re not feeling good about themselves \u2013 it says more about the person who is doing the pressuring than it does about them\n\nYou can also look at\nChildline\u2019s guide to being assertive\ntogether. This might be helpful when they want to say no but they\u2019re not sure how.\n\nOver time, your child or young person may start to realise that they're spending time with a group of people who often make them feel bad about themselves. Listen to what this is like for them. Encourage them to join groups or clubs for the things they\u2019re interested in. This can help them to meet new friends.\n\nExplore what safe and healthy decisions look like for them\n\nThis might include talking about:\n\ntheir own thoughts and feelings about alcohol and drugs\n\nhow they can get to know their limits around alcohol, and stay within these\n\nhow they can make choices that are right for them, rather than the choices they think they \u2018should\u2019 make\n\nwhat kind of people they want to spend time with, and how they want to be treated by their friends\n\nwhat they would say if they were offered alcohol or drugs when they didn\u2019t want them\n\nwhat they can do and say if they get into a situation which makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe\n\nWhen should I be worried about my child or young person?\n\nIt\u2019s normal for teenagers to experiment. Some will drink alcohol or try drugs. But it is not normal for a teenager to:\n\ndrink or take drugs alone\n\nget very drunk or take drugs frequently\n\nfeel like they \u2018need\u2019 alcohol or drugs to cope with social events or other situations\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned that your child is using alcohol or drugs to cope, it\u2019s important to get some help as soon as you can. Getting professional support can prevent things from getting worse. It can also support them to find healthier ways of coping.\nSpeaking to a GP\nand looking into\ncounselling and therapy\nare two good places to start.\n\nSigns your child or young person is developing a more serious problem:\n\nthey are drinking alcohol or taking drugs frequently\n\ntheir drug or alcohol use causes changes in their mood \u2013 for example by making them more irritable, tired, anxious, low or agitated\n\nthey are experiencing other mental health issues such as\nanxiety\nor\nlow-mood\n\nthey are losing interest in the things they used to do, including hobbies or schoolwork\n\nthey have become secretive about what they\u2019re doing, or money or alcohol is regularly going missing\n\nthey build up a tolerance, which means they need to have more and more to feel the effect\n\nonce they start drinking or taking a drug, they find it difficult to stop and often end up drinking or taking a lot\n\nthey feel like they \u2018need\u2019 to drink or take drugs to cope\n\nIf your child is experiencing these things, you need to get specialist help as soon as possible.\n\nWhere to get help for alcohol and drug problems\n\nEach local area has their own drug and alcohol service. Each service offers different types of support and treatment. This often includes things like counselling, recovery plans and family support. If your child or young person is under 18, this service might be at their local NHS mental health team for young people (known as\nCAMHS\n).\n\nThe first step to accessing alcohol and drug services is usually to\nmake an appointment with a GP\n. The GP can discuss what\u2019s happening and refer your child or young person to the right place.\n\nDepending on where you live, your child or young person may be able to refer themselves to CAMHS, or to their local drug and alcohol service. You can find out whether this is possible on the service\u2019s website. They may also be able to join peer support groups. You can find details about\nsupport groups at the end of this page\n.\n\nFinding local drug and alcohol services\n\nThese directories provide a list of drug and alcohol services near you:\n\nFRANK service directory\n, for people in England\n\nScottish Drug Services Directory\n\nDAN 24/7\n, for people in Wales\n\nDrugs and alcohol Northern Ireland\n\nGetting help in an emergency\n\nIf your child or young person needs urgent help after taking drugs or drinking alcohol, call 999 for an ambulance straightaway.\n\nIf you are worried that your child or young person is feeling suicidal, or is not safe, they need urgent help. You can find out who to contact on our\nurgent help page\n. You can also find information and advice about suicidal thoughts in our\nguide for parents and carers\n.\n\nLooking after yourself\n\nIf your child is going through an alcohol or drug problem, it can be a scary and isolating situation to navigate. It\u2019s important to recognise the ways in which it\u2019s affecting you and make time for your own self-care. When your child or young person is struggling, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve done something wrong. Be kind to yourself. Keep in mind all you\u2019re doing to help them. And remember, they can come out the other side and feel okay again.\n\nIf you need some support, you can:\n\ntalk to trusted friends and family members, and ask them for help\n\nreach out to other parents who've been through this\n\nspeak to your GP about getting counselling support for yourself\n\ncall the Samaritans anytime on 116 123 if you need to talk\n\nspeak to any of the organisations listed below\n\nUseful helplines and websites\n\nWhile we take care to ensure that the organisations we signpost to provide high quality information and advice, we cannot take responsibility for any specific pieces of advice they may offer.

Hurting themselves can feel like the only way to cope. Or they might feel numb and hurt themselves so they can feel something.\n\nIf your child is self-harming, or you\u2019re concerned they might be, it can be incredibly worrying. The important thing to remember is that lots of young people go through this and come out the other side with different ways of coping. You also need to remember that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nOn this page, we outline how you can support your child and where you can find professional help.\n\nSigns a young person is self-harming\n\nWays that young people self-harm\n\nSome ways that young people self-harm include:\n\ncutting themselves or pricking the skin with sharp objects\n\nscratching skin with fingernails\n\ndeliberately picking open old wounds or scabs\n\nburning skin\n\nbiting skin\n\nhitting themselves, or banging their head or another part of their body on a wall\n\npulling at their head and body hair\n\ninserting objects into their body\n\nThings to look out for\n\nYou might be worried that a young person is harming themselves, even if they're not talking about it or showing visible injuries. If you\u2019re concerned, you can look out for:\n\nunexplained cuts, burns, bite-marks, bruises or bald patches\n\ncovering their body. They might wear long sleeves or trousers during hot weather, not want to change clothes around others, or avoid activities like swimming\n\nbloody tissues in bins\n\nseeming low or depressed, for example withdrawing from friends and family\n\nblaming themselves for problems or expressing feelings of failure, uselessness or hopelessness\n\noutbursts of anger or argumentativeness\n\nHaving found out my child was self-harming, I was so devastated and confused as to why. My emotions were all over the place, not knowing how to help her, where to go for professional help \u2013 it was so stressful. As a father I just wanted to wrap her up in cotton wool.\n\nReasons why a young person might self-harm\n\nIf a young person is self harming, it\u2019s often a sign that something isn\u2019t quite right or has become too much to deal with. It can be understood as an important message about how a young person is feeling \u2013 one that needs to be noticed with care by the adults around them.\n\nSelf-harm is usually a way of trying to manage very difficult feelings.\u00a0 People often harm themselves when life feels hard to cope with - when distressing feelings have built up and become overwhelming. In the moment, physical pain can be easier than feeling emotionally out of control.\n\nYou might hear myths about self-harm, including that it\u2019s a \u2018phase\u2019, or attention-seeking. In fact, while it might feel hard to understand from the outside, self-harm can be a way for a young person to:\n\nmanage, reduce or express very strong and upsetting emotions like hurt, sadness, anger, fear or feeling bad about themselves\n\nrelieve tension and pressure, or reduce feelings of panic and anxiety, to temporarily feel calmer\n\nexperience a feeling of physical pain to distract from emotional pain\n\ngain a sense of control over feelings or problems \u2013 for example by feeling there\u2019s something they can do when things feel too much\n\nstop feeling numb or \u2018zoned-out\u2019, a protective process our bodies use when we\u2019re overwhelmed.\n\nYet while self-harm can bring relief in the moment, this is only temporary. As feelings build up again, so does the urge to self-harm.\n\nAs this cycle continues, someone might start to feel ashamed, confused, or frightened. This increases the load they\u2019re already carrying, becoming a cycle that\u2019s hard to break and a habit that\u2019s hard to stop.\n\nOften it\u2019s a way for people to let out feelings that are hard to explain or control.\n\nYou probably feel better at the time, but then the guilt sets in, and then it\u2019s just the cycle. It never really makes the emotion go away.\n\nSupporting your child with the urge to self-harm\n\nWhen the urge to self-harm does build, it's useful for your child to have a list of other things they can do instead. This can help 'ride the wave' of intense feelings without self-harming.\n\nDifferent things will work for different people. What helps usually depends on the feelings your child is trying to manage. If your child wants to feel soothed, they might want to wrap themselves up in a comfy space. If they want to burn off energy, doing something active can help.\n\nYour child might want to use an app like\nCalm Harm\nso they have something on their phone that suggests different techniques they can try when they feel the urge to self-harm.\n\nStrategies to try when they feel like self-harming\n\nStrategies could include:\n\nmaking and using a\nself soothe box\n\nwriting down how they\u2019re feeling in a journal\n\nwriting down difficult feelings on pieces of paper and then ripping them up\n\nripping up a magazine or newspaper\n\nhitting a soft cushion, pillow or bean bag\n\nlistening to loud music\n\nhaving a shower\n\ndoing some exercise\n\ngoing for a walk outside, or taking the dog for a walk\n\nfocusing on their breathing \u2013 how it feels in their body to breathe in and out\n\nwrapping up in a blanket or duvet. Some people find weighted blankets particularly useful\n\ntalking to someone \u2013 a friend, family member or calling a helpline\n\ntidying or organising something\n\ndoing a hobby they enjoy that helps them feel calm, such as painting, drawing, colouring-in, watching a favourite TV programme, playing video games, cooking or baking\n\ncrossing the arms and placing one hand in icy water and the other hand in warm water - this creates an unpleasant \u201cshock\u201d effect, but is not dangerous\n\nusing an elastic band over the wrist or other body part to produce a sensation of pain - this is safe and does not cause any permanent damage or injury\n\nSupporting your child to manage their feelings\n\nThere are a number of things that might empower your child to feel more in control. Becoming more aware of what they're feeling when they self-harm can help, as can understanding what's making them want to do it. They might also want to think about what could help them stop. This knowledge can reduce overwhelm and their need to self-harm. To support them with this, you can:\n\nTry to open up a conversation about what\u2019s going on\n\nIt might help to start this while walking outside or doing an activity to keep the chat more relaxed. It can also help both of you to be in a neutral space - e.g. not in their bedroom. Take a look at our\nactivity ideas for starting a conversation\n.\nUnderstandably, you might have lots of questions. But it\u2019s important to remember your child is going through a tough time and may find this overwhelming. Focus on finding out how they\u2019re doing without bombarding them.\n\nKeep communication as open as you can, letting your child know they can talk to you anytime\n\nYour child might feel ashamed about self-harming and find it difficult to talk about. Let them come to you when they feel ready, and reassure them that they can talk to you as often and for as long as they need to.\nIf your child is struggling to open up, they might find it easier to text or write a letter, or communicate how they feel through writing, pictures, or music. This can be particularly helpful for neurodiverse young people. Receiving information this way also gives you time to process what they\u2019ve told you, and think about how you\u2019d like to respond without immediately reacting.\n\nStay calm and non-judgemental\n\nWhen your child does open up, try to focus on listening, showing empathy and being curious about what it\u2019s like for them, rather than trying to \u2018fix\u2019 things. Sometimes they'll just want you to listen and understand how they are feeling - not be given a solution.\n\nThink together about what\u2019s causing them to self-harm\n\nSelf-harm is usually a symptom of something else that\u2019s going on. Are there things like relationships or experiences at home or school that are making them feel worried, frightened, upset or angry? Are there changes that could be made to make things better? Taking pressures away can help reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n\nHelp them to notice when the urge to self-harm builds, and how they\u2019re feeling when that happens\n\nWhat kinds of thoughts are they having, and how do they feel in their body? For example, they might start to feel more zoned out or like they\u2019re full of panic. This can help them recognise what feelings they\u2019re trying to deal with, and what they can do instead to manage them. Keeping a mood diary might help them understand this over time - and can be as simple as a noted-down word, phrase or emoji every day.\n\nSpend quality time together doing activities they enjoy\n\nEven if it\u2019s just for a little while, doing something fun can give your child a break and help them relax. This might be drawing, making something, playing sport, cooking, or watching a favourite film together.\n\nHelp them do the daily things that support our wellbeing\n\nGetting up at a regular time, eating regular healthy meals, exercising, drinking water, spending quality time with loved ones and getting enough sleep can help (teens need a minimum of 8-10 hours per night). It might help to think about limits around screen time as part of this.\n\nAsk your child if there are things that would help them to feel more safe\n\nThink about replacing potentially harmful everyday items with safer alternatives. Some young people, for example, might use the safety pins they use to secure their hijab or other items of clothing to harm themselves. In cases like this, you might want to secure clothes in a different way with magnets or clips. Certain things in the house might trigger them - ask them about this, and try to find ways to remove or reduce them.\n\nKeep an eye on your child without making them feel policed\n\nIt\u2019s completely natural that you might want to watch over them when you know they self-harm. While monitoring the situation is good, sensing they\u2019re being watched may increase your child's anxiety and guilt. When it feels possible and they need it, give them some space.\n\nSeek professional advice or help\n\nThere are lots of things you can do to help your child. But lots of young people will need professional help to shift the situation and feel better. You can find out how to access help below.\n\nYoung people tell us it's helpful when parents...\n\nAre open-minded and don\u2019t make assumptions\n\nRemember that their child is not doing this for attention \u2013 it\u2019s their way of letting out the pain on their terms\n\nLet their child know they are there to help and aren\u2019t going to judge them\n\nListen to them and offer reassurance. Things like \u2018I\u2019m proud of you\u2019, \u2018we will get through this together\u2019 and \u2018I recognise your pain and want to help\u2019 will go a long way.\n\nYoung people tell us it's unhelpful when parents...\n\nPut too much pressure on their child to stop\n\nForce their child to talk when they\u2019re not ready\n\nMinimise their child\u2019s feelings by saying things like \u2018it\u2019s only puberty\u2019, \u2018it\u2019s just a phase\u2019 or \u2018you need to grow up\u2019.\n\nEmpathise with their emotional state. Life is tough right now and it shouldn\u2019t be, but it is. Make sure your child knows there is so much they can do to make things better, and none of them involve attacking themselves or feeling bad about themselves.\n\nCheck in with your child on a regular basis. It can be easy to feel that everything is back to normal when your child appears to be coping, but it\u2019s essential to monitor what's really happening for your child.\n\nBecome your child\u2019s best critical friend \u2013 compassionate, supportive, encouraging them to seek help and confidential where it matters.\n\nMy mum and dad came into my room and did something brilliant for me. They accepted it. They didn\u2019t shout at me or tell me off.\n\nFinding professional help\n\nThere are different places to find help for your child.\nSpeaking to your GP\nis often a good start. They can discuss concerns, speak to your child to find out how they\u2019re doing, and let you know what support options are available. You can speak to the GP yourself to ask for advice, even if your child doesn\u2019t want to talk to them.\n\nDepending on the situation, the GP can also refer them for an assessment by a mental health specialist, or to\nChild and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)\n. Referrals can be made to CAMHS for young people up to the age of 18 years old, or to adult mental health services for young people aged 18 and over.\n\nSchools, colleges, and universities are another good source of support. They can also refer to mental health services, and often have their own mental health provision. Referrals from school can be very useful. They see the young person on a daily basis and can sometimes give more insight into their needs.\n\nSome young people may find it helpful to speak to a counsellor or therapist, who can help them make sense of how they\u2019re feeling and find new ways of coping. Our\nguide to counselling services\ntakes you through the process of finding a counsellor or therapist for your child.\n\nMore about getting support from mental health services\n\nGet support from our Parents Helpline\n\nTrying to find the right help for your child and finding your way around different services can be really tiring at times \u2013 so keep reminding yourself that you\u2019re doing your best and that it\u2019s not easy.\n\nSome young people who are self-harming will find it very difficult to speak to a professional, go to appointments or even acknowledge what\u2019s going on. If things are feeling stuck, you can call our Parents Helpline for information, advice and support.\n\nYoungMinds Parents Helpline\n\nTips from parents who've been in this situation\n\nParents have found the following things helpful when seeking professional help:\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling under a lot of strain, or like the situation is too much to manage, it may be a sign you need professional help.\n\nTry to speak to professionals early on before things have escalated to crisis.\n\nEncourage your child to give themselves some time to get to know a professional and build trust. Remember that they might be starting from a very withdrawn place.\n\nRemind your child that therapy is not always easy. Finding it difficult is normal, rather than a sign it\u2019s not working.\n\nAsk if you can see the same professional each time so that you don\u2019t have to keep re-explaining the situation.\n\nBe open minded about different types of treatment. What works for your child might not be the same as what would work for you.\n\nKeeping your child safe\n\nIt\u2019s important to take your child to hospital or to your GP if they have any injuries that require medical attention.\n\nSelf-harm is often a way to help someone cope. It isn\u2019t necessarily an expression of suicidal feelings or an attempt to take their own life.\n\nBut people who experience suicidal thoughts are more likely to have self-harmed in the past. If you\u2019re worried your child may be experiencing suicidal thoughts,\u00a0 read our guide to find out how you can access help.\n\nGuide to suicidal thoughts\n\nMy child needs urgent help\n\nIf your child is having a mental health crisis and needs urgent help now, find out who to contact on our urgent help page.\n\nIf your child\u2019s life is at risk, or if it does not feel like they\u2019re safe, please call 999 for an ambulance or take them straight to A&E.\n\nMy child needs urgent help\n\nLooking after yourself\n\nFinding out that your child is self-harming can be an incredibly distressing, or even traumatic, experience. It\u2019s completely normal to feel anxious, confused, sad, angry, frustrated, guilty or ashamed.\n\nTry to take time when you can to check in with yourself, and to think about ways you can take care of yourself too.\u202f It\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it, and to share your worries with someone you trust.\n\nMany parents in this situation find it helpful to reach out to other parents to talk through how they have handled difficult situations and found support. You may also be able to find a local parent support group using the\nCharlie Waller Trust directory\n.\n\nIf you need more help, speaking to your GP is a good place to start. They may be able to refer you to a local support service.\u00a0 Sometimes it helps just having someone there who can listen to what you\u2019re going through. If you need someone to talk to, you can call the Samaritans any time on 116 123.\n\nTry to ignore the feelings of guilt about helping yourself. You need to be well, both physically and mentally, to support your child to the best of your ability. You need to take extra care during this difficult time.\n\nDon\u2019t panic. Seek help. Make sure you\u2019re eating, drinking and sleeping properly yourself.\n\nUseful helplines and websites\n\nWhile we take care to ensure that the organisations we signpost to provide high quality information and advice, we cannot take responsibility for any specific pieces of advice they may offer.
