    "text": "\ufeff Cuts and grazes - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search Cuts and grazes Most cuts and grazes can be treated at home and will start to heal in a few days. But some wounds may need to be treated by a medical professional if there's a risk of infection or the cut is serious. How to treat a cut or graze yourself You can treat a cut or graze yourself by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound, and covering it with a plaster or dressing. This will help stop it getting infected. If it's painful, you can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (but do not give aspirin to children under ). What to do if the wound is bleeding a lot Check the wound and make sure there's nothing stuck in it. If there's nothing in the wound, put pressure on it using a bandage or a clean, folded cloth (such as a tea towel) for  minutes. If there's something stuck in the wound, do not try to take it out. Make sure not to press down on the object. Press firmly either side of it to push the edges of the wound together. If the wound is on your hand or arm, raise it above your head. If the wound is on your lower limb, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce the blood flow. When the bleeding has stopped, firmly wrap a new bandage over the first cloth or bandage. If the wound keeps bleeding, leave the first bandage in place and add another one. Keep pressing firmly on the wound for another  minutes. How to clean and dress a cut or graze If the bleeding has stopped, you can clean a small wound and then put a plaster or dressing over it. Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Put on disposable gloves if you have some. Clean the wound by rinsing it with bottled or tap water, or by using sterile wipes.

    "text": "\ufeff Burns and scalds - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search Overview - Burns and scalds Burns and scalds are damage to the skin usually caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way. A burn is caused by dry heat \u2013 by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam. Credit: SCOTT CAMAZINE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media//view Burns can be very painful and may cause: red or peeling skin blisters swelling white or charred skin The amount of pain you feel is not always related to how serious the burn is. Even a very serious burn may be relatively painless. Treating burns and scalds To treat a burn, follow the first aid advice below: immediately get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning remove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies, but do not move anything that's stuck to the skin cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for  to  minutes \u2013 do not use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter make sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area after cooling the burn, cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it \u2013 a clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain raise the affected area if possible \u2013 this helps to reduce swelling if it's an acid or chemical burn , dial  , carefully try to remove the chemical and any contaminated clothing, and rinse the affected area using as much clean water as possible Read more about treating burns and scalds . When to get medical attention Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home. For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form. More serious burns require professional medical attention. You should go to a hospital A&E department for: all chemical and electrical burns large or deep burns \u2013 any burn bigger than the injured person's hand burns that cause white or charred skin \u2013 any size burns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals If someone has breathed in smoke or fumes, they should also get medical attention. Some symptoms may be delayed and can include: coughing a sore throat difficulty breathing facial burns People at greater risk from the effects of burns, such as children under  years old, should also get medical attention after a burn or scald. The size and depth of the burn will be assessed, and the affected area cleaned before a dressing is applied. In severe cases, skin graft surgery may be recommended. Read more about: recovering from burns and scalds complications of burns and scalds Types of burn Burns are assessed by how seriously your skin is damaged and which layers of skin are affected. Your skin has  layers: the epidermis \u2013 the outer layer of skin the dermis \u2013 the layer of tissue just beneath, which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands and hair follicles the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis \u2013 the deeper layer of fat and tissue There are  main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms: superficial epidermal burn \u2013 where the epidermis is damaged; your skin will be red, slightly swollen and painful, but not blistered superficial dermal burn \u2013 where the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged; your skin will be pale pink and painful, and there may be small blisters deep dermal or partial thickness burn \u2013 where the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; this type of burn makes your skin turn red and blotchy; your skin may be dry or moist and become swollen and blistered, and it may be very painful or painless full thickness burn \u2013 where all  layers of skin (the epidermis, dermis and subcutis) are damaged; the skin is often burnt away and the tissue underneath may appear pale or blackened, while the remaining skin will be dry and white, brown or black with no blisters. The texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. It may also be painless Preventing burns and scalds Many severe burns and scalds affect babies and young children. Examples of things you can do to help reduce the likelihood of your child having a serious accident at home include: keeping your child out of the kitchen whenever possible testing the temperature of bath water using your elbow before you put your baby or toddler in the bath keeping matches, lighters and lit candles out of young children's sight and reach keeping hot drinks well away from young children Read more about preventing burns and scalds .

A pharmacist can help with sprains and strains Speak to a pharmacist about the best treatment for you. They might suggest tablets, or a cream or gel you rub on the skin. At first, try painkillers like paracetamol to ease the pain and ibuprofen gel, mousse or spray to bring down swelling. If needed, you can take ibuprofen tablets, capsules or syrup that you swallow. Find a pharmacy How long it takes for a sprain or strain to heal After  weeks, most sprains and strains will feel better.

Strains often affect new runners, whose muscles are not used to running. What does muscle strain feel like? The pain of a muscle strain is often sudden and feels as if someone has kicked you in the area of your calf or hamstring. What should I do about a muscle strain? Most strains can be treated at home.

You will not be able to run with a muscle strain. The time it takes for a strain to heal and for you to start running again can take months, depending on how severe the muscle strain is. Tips for preventing injury Wear the right shoes It's important to buy the correct running shoes, and it's best to go to a running shop to get fitted. But you do not have to spend a lot of money. Expensive shoes may just be more durable and lightweight, so more suitable for people running long distances. All running shoe brands make cheaper versions that are suitable for beginners. Warm up and cool down It's essential to warm up properly before you start running. Five to  minutes of brisk walking or gentle jogging before you start will warm your muscles up and help prevent injury. To cool down, carry on running at an easier pace or walk for  to  minutes. This will help your body recover after your run. Build up slowly Do not be tempted to increase the intensity or distance of your running too quickly. Do a similar run at least  or  times before you increase your pace or distance. The Couch to 5K plan is perfect as it builds up the distance gradually. The plan is suitable for beginners and will get you running  times a week, building up to 5km in  weeks. Staying motivated if you have an injury Being injured can be very frustrating. If you're new to running, you might be tempted to give up at the first sign of injury. Having a specific goal, such as a 5km race or charity run, will help you stay motivated through injury. If you have something to work towards, you'll be much more likely to get back into running once you've recovered. Running with a partner is also a great way to stay motivated. If they carry on running while you're injured, you'll want to get back out there once you're better as you will not want to let them down. Page last reviewed:  November  Next review due:  November",

    "text": "\ufeff Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy Bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common and does not always mean there's a problem \u2013 but it can be a dangerous sign. Urgent advice: Call your midwife or GP immediately if: you have any bleeding from your vagina Causes of bleeding in early pregnancy Implantation bleeding In early pregnancy, you might get some harmless light bleeding, called \"spotting\". This is when the developing embryo plants itself in the wall of your womb. This type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due. Cervical changes Pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and this may sometimes cause bleeding \u2013 after sex, for example. Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy During the first  weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy . If you bleed at this stage of pregnancy and the pregnancy ends, there is no reason for you not to go on to have a successful pregnancy. Treating bleeding in early pregnancy You may be offered a medicine called progesterone to stop bleeding in early pregnancy. This will only be recommended if you've had a scan to confirm you're pregnant and you've had a miscarriage before. Your doctor may recommend you take the medicine twice a day until you're  weeks pregnant. Miscarriage If a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it's called a miscarriage. Around  in  pregnancies ends this way. Many early miscarriages (before  weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. There can also be other causes of miscarriage, such as hormone or blood clotting problems. Most miscarriages occur during the first  weeks ( months) of pregnancy and, sadly, most cannot be prevented. Other symptoms of miscarriage include: cramping and pain in your lower abdomen a discharge or fluid from your vagina a discharge of tissue from your vagina no longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick If you have bleeding or any of these symptoms, contact your midwife or GP straightaway. Ectopic pregnancy An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb \u2013 for example, in the fallopian tube. It can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg cannot develop properly outside the womb. The egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between  to  weeks of pregnancy but can happen later. Other signs of ectopic pregnancy can include: tummy pain low down which may be on one side vaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge pain in the tip of your shoulder discomfort when peeing or pooing Call  if you have symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy. Causes of bleeding in later pregnancy Cervical changes These can lead to bleeding, particularly after sex. Vaginal infections Your midwife or doctor can discuss tests and treatment with you. A 'show' This is when the plug of mucus that has been in the cervix during pregnancy comes away, signalling that the cervix is getting ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself. Find out about the signs of labour and what happens in labour and birth . Placental abruption This is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the womb wall. Placental abruption usually causes stomach pain, and this may occur even if there is no bleeding. Low-lying placenta (placenta praevia) This is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the womb, near to or covering the cervix. Bleeding from a low-lying placenta can be very heavy, and put you and your baby at risk. You may be advised to go into hospital for emergency treatment, and a caesarean section will usually be recommended. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website has more information on placenta praevia . Vasa praevia This is a rare condition where the baby's blood vessels run through the membranes covering the cervix. When your waters break, these vessels may be torn and cause vaginal bleeding. The baby can lose a life-threatening amount of blood. Finding out the cause of bleeding in pregnancy To work out what is causing the bleeding, you may need to have a vaginal or pelvic examination, an ultrasound scan or blood tests to check your hormone levels. Your doctor will also ask you about other symptoms, such as cramp, pain and dizziness. Sometimes it might not be possible to find out what caused the bleeding. If your symptoms are not severe and your baby is not due for a while, you'll be monitored and, in some cases, kept in hospital for observation. How long you need to stay in hospital depends on the cause of the bleeding and how many weeks pregnant you are. Being in hospital allows staff to keep an eye on you and your baby, so they can act quickly if there are further problems.

Warning Definition: Incomplete compression fracture at the metaphysis of the distal radius, ulna or both in which one cortex is disrupted, and the other remains intact.  Buckle fractures are common injuries sustained by children > years old  , typically following a fall on the outstretched hand. As the developing bone is relatively soft, the trabeculae is compressed, resulting in the appearance of a bulge. This is most frequently seen on the dorsal aspect of the distal radius but can appear on distal ulna or both distal ulna and radius. The bulge may be seen at both the ulnar and radial aspects of the bone. Example xray of distal radius buckle fracture: Case courtesy of Dr Maulik S Patel, Radiopaedia.org . From the case rID:  Pitfalls Be careful not to misdiagnose Salter Harris II or Greenstick fractures as a simple Buckle fracture, as these can be unstable  requiring immobilisation with cast, and orthopaedic follow up. Check that both cortices are intact on the anteroposterior (AP) and the lateral x-rays and that there is no significant angulation (eg more than  degrees) Example xray of greenstick fracture of distal radius: (demonstrating extension of fracture line to volar cortex with angulation of the volar cortex) Images from: Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne - Greenstick fracture distal radius Management: Buckle fractures have excellent cosmetic and functional prognosis. A rigid cast is not recommended  , instead a removable splint should be applied. This has been shown to be at least as effective as a cast in terms of facilitating healing, but can promote earlier functional recovery. Splint can be used if there is a buckle seen on both radius and ulna. These patients can be discharged with a parent information leaflet and no planned follow up. ,,,, Advice to Parents: The splint should be worn for  weeks, but can be removed for bathing, showering and for sleep. The child should receive regular simple analgesia for the first few days following injury. They will usually be fine to attend school after the first day. If the child remains in significant distress despite the splint and regular analgesia, they should return to ED for review. If after  weeks the wrist still seems very sore, swollen, or the child is not willing to use it, please contact the ED secretary on    where follow up arrangements will be made. Once the splint is removed the children should avoid contact sports or high energy activities (such as rough and tumble play) for a further  weeks to avoid further injury Parents should be provided with an information leaflet containing the above information.

From: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency Published  March  Last updated  September  \u2014 See all updates Get emails about this page Print this page GB driver licensing Licensing and licence groups The GB medical standards for driver licensing refer to Group  and Group  licence holders: Group  includes cars and motorcycles Group  includes large lorries (category C) and buses (category D) In most cases, the medical standards for Group  drivers are substantially higher than for Group  drivers. This is because of the size and weight of the vehicle and the length of time an occupational driver typically spends at the wheel. Drivers who were awarded a Group  category B (motor car) licence before  January  have additional entitlement to categories C1 (medium-sized lorries, .5t to .5t) and D1 (minibuses,  to  seats, not for hire or reward). Drivers with this entitlement retain it only until their licence expires or it is revoked for medical reasons. On subsequent renewal or reapplication, the higher medical standards applicable to Group  will apply. Under certain circumstances, volunteer drivers may drive a minibus of up to  seats without category D1 entitlement. DVLA outlines the rules for such circumstances on the GOV.UK website (see Driving a minibus ). Age limits for licensing Group  Licences are normally valid until  years of age (the \u2019til  licence) unless restricted to a shorter duration for medical reasons. There is no upper age limit to licensing, but after  renewal is required every  years. A person in receipt of the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) can hold a driving licence from  years of age. (A person can\u2019t apply for PIP until their 16th birthday.) Group  The minimum age for Group  entitlement to drive lorries (category C) is  and for buses (category D) is , unless the driver is undergoing or has passed the Driver Certificate of Competence (CPC) initial qualification which they can do at the age of . The Group  licensing entitlement is valid for a maximum of  years. Group  licences must be renewed every  years or at age , whichever is the earlier, until the age of  when they are renewed annually without an upper age limit. Shorter licences may be issued for medical reasons. There are exceptions, such as driving in the armed forces, and people of a minimum age of  can drive lorries and buses after gaining, or training towards, the Driver CPC. All initial Group  licence applications require a medical assessment by a registered medical practitioner (recorded on the D4 form). The same assessment is required again at  years of age and on any subsequent reapplication. Police, fire, ambulance and health service driver licensing The same medical standards apply for drivers of police, fire, coastguard, ambulance and health service vehicles as they do for all drivers holding Group  and  licences. Any responsibility for determining higher medical standards, over and above these licensing requirements, rests with the individual force, service or other relevant body. Taxi licensing Responsibility for determining any higher standards and medical requirements for taxi drivers, over and above the driver licensing requirements, rests with Transport for London in the Metropolitan area, or the local council in all other areas. Decisions taken by employers on the use and application of the GB standards on fitness to drive in particular circumstances and as they relate to employees are for the employer to make. Any responsibility for determining higher medical standards, over and above these licensing requirements, rests with the individual force, service or other relevant body. Interpretation of GB legislation The advice of the Honorary Medical Advisory Panels on the interpretation of GB legislation and its appropriate application is made within the context of driver licensing. Sudden disabling events Anyone with a medical condition likely to cause a sudden disabling event at the wheel, or who is unable to control their vehicle safely for any other reason, must not drive. DVLA defines the risk of a sudden disabling event as: % likelihood of an event in  year for Group  licensing % likelihood of an event in  year for Group  licensing These figures, while originally defined by older studies, have since been revalidated by more recent risk-of-harm calculations. DVLA notification by drivers or healthcare professionals Applicants and licence holders have a legal duty to: notify DVLA of any injury or illness that would have a likely impact on safe driving ability (except some short-term conditions that are unlikely to continue beyond  months, as set out in this guide) respond fully and accurately to any requests for information from either DVLA or healthcare professionals comply with the requirements of the issued licence, including any periodic medical reviews indicated by DVLA They should also adhere, with ongoing consideration of fitness to drive, to prescribed medical treatment, and to monitor and manage the condition and any adaptations. Doctors and other healthcare professionals should: advise the individual on the impact of their medical condition for safe driving ability advise the individual on their legal requirement to notify DVLA of any relevant condition treat, manage and monitor the individual\u2019s condition with ongoing consideration of their fitness to drive notify DVLA when fitness to drive requires notification but an individual cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves Of course, this last obligation on professionals may pose a challenge to issues of authorisation and the relationship between patient and healthcare professional. The General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Optical Council (GOC) offer guidance on this which is summarised below. In law it is the duty of the licence holder or applicant to notify DVLA of any medical condition that may affect safe driving. This notification by people with licences issued by DVLA (because they live in England, Scotland or Wales) may be done via GOV.UK \u2013 see Medical conditions, disabilities and driving . For people with licences issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland, the options for direct notification are given on the NI Direct page: How to tell DVA about a medical condition . Circumstances may arise in which a person cannot or will not notify DVLA. It may be necessary for a doctor, optometrist or other healthcare professional to consider notifying DVLA under such circumstances if there is concern for road safety, which would be for both the individual and the wider public. The General Medical Council (GMC) and the General Optical Council (GOC) offer clear guidance about notifying DVLA when the person cannot or will not exercise their own legal duty to do so. The GMC guidelines  (reproduced with permission) state: .In our guidance Confidentiality: good practice in handling patient information we say: .Trust is an essential part of the doctor-patient relationship and confidentiality is central to this. Patients may avoid seeking medical help, or may under-report symptoms, if they think that their personal information will be disclosed by doctors without consent, or without the chance to have some control over the timing or amount of information shared. .Doctors owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients, but they also have a wider duty to protect and promote the health of patients and the public. .You should ask for a patient\u2019s consent to disclose information for the protection of others unless it is not safe or practicable to do so, or the information is required by law. You should consider any reasons given for refusal. .If it is not practicable to seek consent, and in exceptional cases where a patient has refused consent, disclosing personal information may be justified in the public interest if failure to do so may expose others to a risk of death or serious harm. The benefits to an individual or to society of the disclosure must outweigh both the patient\u2019s and the public interest in keeping the information confidential. .If you consider that failure to disclose the information would leave individuals or society exposed to a risk so serious that it outweighs patients\u2019 and the public interest in maintaining confidentiality, you should disclose relevant information promptly to an appropriate person or authority. You should inform the patient before disclosing the information, if it is practicable and safe to do so, even if you intend to disclose without their consent. About this guidance .Doctors owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients, but they also have a wider duty to protect and promote the health of patients and the public. This explanatory guidance sets out the steps doctors should take if a patient\u2019s failure or refusal to stop driving exposes others to a risk of death or serious harm. Fitness to drive: doctors\u2019 and patients\u2019 responsibilities .The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in England, Scotland and Wales and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland are legally responsible for deciding if a person is medically unfit to drive. This means they need to know if a person holding a driving licence has a condition or is undergoing treatment that may now, or in the future, affect their safety as a driver. .The driver is legally responsible for telling the DVLA or DVA about any such condition or treatment. Doctors should therefore alert patients to conditions and treatments that might affect their ability to drive and remind them of their duty to tell the appropriate agency. Doctors may, however, need to make a decision about whether to disclose relevant information without consent to the DVLA or DVA in the public interest if a patient is unfit to drive but continues to do so. Assessing a patient\u2019s fitness to drive .When diagnosing a patient\u2019s condition, or providing or arranging treatment, you should consider whether the condition or treatment may affect their ability to drive safely. You should: refer to the DVLA\u2019s guidance Assessing fitness to drive \u2013 a guide for medical professionals, which includes information about disorders and conditions that can impair a patient\u2019s fitness to drive seek the advice of an experienced colleague or the DVLA\u2019s or DVA\u2019s medical adviser if you are not sure whether a condition or treatment might affect a patient\u2019s fitness to drive. Reporting concerns to the DVLA or DVA .If a patient has a condition or is undergoing treatment that could impair their fitness to drive, you should: a. explain this to the patient and tell them that they have a legal duty to inform the DVLA or DVA b. tell the patient that you may be obliged to disclose relevant medical information about them, in confidence, to the DVLA or DVA if they continue to drive when they are not fit to do so c. make a note of any advice you have given to a patient about their fitness to drive in their medical record. .If a patient is incapable of understanding this advice \u2013 for example, because of dementia \u2013 you should inform the DVLA or DVA as soon as practicable. .If a patient refuses to accept the diagnosis, or the effect of the condition or treatment on their ability to drive, you can suggest that they seek a second opinion, and help arrange for them to do so. You should advise the patient not to drive in the meantime. As long as the patient agrees, you may discuss your concerns with their relatives, friends or carers. .If you become aware that a patient is continuing to drive when they may not be fit to do so, you should make every reasonable effort to persuade them to stop. If you do not manage to persuade the patient to stop driving, or you discover that they are continuing to drive against your advice, you should consider whether the patient\u2019s refusal to stop driving leaves others exposed to a risk of death or serious harm. If you believe that it does, you should contact the DVLA or DVA promptly and disclose any relevant medical information, in confidence, to the medical adviser. .Before contacting the DVLA or DVA, you should try to inform the patient of your intention to disclose personal information. If the patient objects to the disclosure, you should consider any reasons they give for objecting. If you decide to contact the DVLA or DVA, you should tell your patient in writing once you have done so, and make a note on the patient\u2019s record. Responding to requests for information from the DVLA or the DVA .If you agree to prepare a report or complete or sign a document to assist the DVLA\u2019s or the DVA\u2019s assessment of a patient\u2019s fitness to drive, you should do so without unreasonable delay. See the full guidance on the GMC website: Confidentiality: patients\u2019 fitness to drive and reporting concerns to the DVLA or DVA . The GOC offers similar guidance, available in full at its website under the confidentiality section of its General Optical Council Standards (use the subsection on \u2018disclosing confidential information about patients with or without consent\u2019). This guidance includes the following (reproduced with permission of GOC): Disclosing information with consent Where you are not sharing information with other healthcare professionals for the purpose of providing (or supporting the provision of) direct care to a patient, you should always try to get your patient\u2019s explicit consent to disclose sensitive information about them, unless any of the following apply: a. obtaining consent would defeat the purpose of the disclosure (for example, where there would be a risk of harm to others; where detection of a serious crime would be obstructed); or b. you have already made the decision to disclose information in the public interest and obtaining consent would be meaningless or tokenistic; or c. the patient is not able to give consent as a result of disability, illness or injury. A patient\u2019s ability to give consent is referred to as their \u2018capacity\u2019 to consent. For more information on capacity, including what to do if a patient lacks capacity, see our consent guidance. Where your patient provides you with explicit consent to disclose confidential information about them, you must ensure that they know what they are consenting to (see Standards  and  of the Standards of Practice, and our consent guidance) and that they are clear what information is going to be disclosed, why it is being disclosed and to which person or authority. Where you are relying on implied consent (see paragraph  above), patients should not be surprised to learn how their information is used; if the information would be used in ways that patients would not reasonably expect, you should seek explicit consent for this from the patient. It is important to remember that patients with the capacity to consent have the right to make their own decisions and to refuse consent, even where you or others may consider the decision to be ill-advised. If a patient makes a decision contrary to clinical advice, you should document this in the patient records so that it is clear to all involved in that patient\u2019s care. Disclosing information without consent If a patient does not provide you with explicit consent to disclose confidential information about them, and if you cannot rely on implied consent, there may still be circumstances in which you may pass the information on to an appropriate authority, such as where it is in the public interest, or where there is a legal requirement for you to do so. Notification can be provided by healthcare professionals in the above circumstances, in confidence: By email: medadviser@dvla.gov.uk By post: Medical Business Support D7 West DVLA Swansea SA6 7JL For Northern Ireland Please contact DVA. Email: DVAUrgentMedical@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk Post: Drivers Medical Section Driver and Vehicle Agency County Hall Castlerock Road Coleraine BT51 3TB How DVLA responds to notification and applies the medical standards Once DVLA is notified of a medical condition and obtains authorisation, it will make medical enquiries as required. The Secretary of State (in practice, DVLA) is unable to make a licensing decision until all the relevant medical information is available and has been considered. Exceptions to this do exist, specifically DVLA\u2019s ability to revoke a licence immediately in the interests of road safety and without detailed enquiry if individual case circumstances dictate this. DVLA\u2019s medical enquiries procedure is generally a -stage process: Information on the medical condition is sought from the licence holder or applicant, either by paper questionnaire or online Information is sought from relevant healthcare professionals, either by questionnaire or provision of medical notes. In some circumstances DVLA will require independent review by a DVLA-appointed doctor or optician/optometrist. Depending on individual circumstances, a licence applicant may also require a driving assessment and/or appraisal. Driving during medical enquiries The time taken to obtain all necessary reports can be lengthy but a licence holder may retain entitlement to drive under Section  of the Road Traffic Act . However, a driver whose last licence was revoked or refused because of a medical condition or is a high risk offender re-applying after a drink/drive disqualification from  June  would not, however, be eligible to drive until they are issued with a new licence. The driver may be covered to drive, but this carries implications for road safety in that the licence holder may continue to drive with a medical condition that, on completion of DVLA\u2019s enquiries, may ultimately result in licence withdrawal. It is for the patient to assure themselves that they are fit to drive. Medical professionals who are asked for an opinion about a patient\u2019s fitness to drive in these circumstances should explain the likely outcome by reference to this guide. The final decision in relation to driver licensing will, however, rest with DVLA. By reference to DVLA\u2019s guidance, the doctor in charge of an individual\u2019s care should be able to advise the driver whether or not it is safe for them to continue to drive during this period. Patients must be reminded that if they choose to ignore medical advice to stop driving this may affect the validity of their motor insurance cover. Doctors are advised to formally and clearly document the advice given. DVLA is solely reliant on doctors and other healthcare professionals for the provision of medical information. To make timely licensing decisions that impact on the safety of the individual and the public, DVLA needs information to be provided as quickly as possible. When DVLA holds all relevant information, a decision can then be made as to whether or not the driver or applicant satisfies the national medical guidelines and the requirements of the law. A licence is accordingly issued or refused/revoked. Outcome of medical enquiries DVLA does not routinely tell doctors of the outcome of a medical enquiry. Drivers are always informed of the outcome, either by being issued a licence or by notification of a refusal or revocation. For cases in which the driver may not have the insight and/or memory function to abide by the refusal or revocation of their licence \u2013 for example, in cognitive impairment, dementia or a mental health condition \u2013 DVLA may, in exceptional circumstances, send a decision letter to the GP in line with prevailing legislation and GMC guidance on disclosures in the public interest. When a notification is received from a doctor in accordance with the GMC guidelines, unless relevant to one of these conditions affecting mental capacity, DVLA will send an acknowledgement letter only to the GP, to confirm receipt of the original notification. Medical notification form for use by healthcare professionals The medical notification form for use when patients cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves is available, for use by healthcare professionals only, on GOV.UK. This form is only for patients living in England, Scotland or Wales who hold a driving licence issued by DVLA. The completed form should be returned to: medadviser@dvla.gov.uk Or by post: Medical Business Support D7 West DVLA Swansea SA6 7JL For patients living in Northern Ireland who cannot or will not self-notify, please use these contact details.

Parts A and B are for your patient\u2019s and your own details, including your signed and dated declaration that all details are correct to the best of your knowledge. Part C of the form should be completed in all fields and providing as much detail as possible regarding your patient\u2019s medical condition. You may send clinic letters with this notification, to help provide details of your patient\u2019s medical condition or if you think it will aid the licensing decision. Please note, your patient can request copies of any medical documents held at DVLA unless you specify in writing that releasing this information could cause serious harm to your patient.

What is Patients Know Best? Patients Know Best is the world s largest online health record that helps you access and share your health information with healthcare professionals, family and carers, using a computer, smartphone or tablet or any device that has an internet connection. Physiotherapy have introduced a method of communicating electronically with their patients. Any patient registered with a GP in the South Devon area is now invited to create a Patients Know Best account to communicate directly with the Physiotherapy team at Torbay Hospital whilst enabling the patient to access information and store their medical records. For help and information about Patients Know Best, including how to register and send messages to your clinician, email help@patientsknowbest.com Patients Know Best frequently asked questions Is it medically secure? Yes. Patients Know Best is covered by the Data Protection Act and operates within strict NHS security standards. Who owns the information? The system operates for your benefit and is a patient-owned medical records and communication system, which enables you to allow others to discuss your health and treatment. Why can\u2019t I use email to communicate with my healthcare team? The system needs to ensure confidentiality, and because email cannot itself guarantee only the intended recipient reads the message, a safe way of electronically communicating has been offered: PKB. All information about your health is kept safe in the secure PKB website at all times. This makes it a lot safer and more secure than using your regular email account. When receiving a message through the PKB system, you will receive a notification into your normal email to look in your PKB account. This is a similar model to that which banks use when communicating financial information with their customers. How can I learn more about the service? Please visit the Patients Know Best website for further information and case studies . For help and information about Patients Know Best, including how to send messages to your clinician, email help@patientsknowbest.com Are other hospitals using Patients Know Best? It is used internationally, and one of the benefits for patients is if you need to seek medical attention when abroad you will be able to access your medical record anywhere in the world through a computer, tablet or smartphone connected to the internet. This will help you share your medical information when abroad or on holiday. How can I verify my account? Your clinical team will need to verify your account so that they can confirm that you are the patient before medical information is sent to you. Please note: If you have an account opened for you directly by your doctor, they know you already, so your account will already be verified. As the Physiotherapy team are trialling the new system, they are currently unable to verify patients\u2019 accounts \u2013 however we are looking to set this up in the coming months. When this happens, you will be asked to bring proof of identification to your appointment to fully activate your account. If an account is verified and contains the patient\u2019s NHS number, information from the hospital can start to automatically flow into the account. Patients will also be able to invite other professionals and carers to view your record should you wish. Are you accessing PKB using the NHS App? If so, please follow the following instructions to complete your appointment request / referral form. Navigate to the messaging section \u2013 it is found in the NHS app \u201cmessages\u201d area and is the option titled \u201cview messages from your hospital or specialist doctors.\u201d Click continue Click Start Consultation / Questionnaire Select Physio Appointment Request Form .

Tablets and capsules Tablets and capsules should be swallowed whole with a drink of water or juice. Tell your child not to chew, break, crush or suck them as this could irritate their mouth or throat. Children taking chewable capsules should chew them before swallowing.

Do not mix the granules with warm food or warm liquid. Your child should then swallow the food, or drink the liquid straight away without chewing. Make sure they take it all.

Gastroenteritis is an upset tummy that can cause diarrhoea and/or vomiting. It is caused by viruses, is often mild and can usually be managed at home . Your child may first have tummy ache and fever Most children with diarrhoea and vomiting get better very quickly, but some children can get worse. Diarrhoea usually lasts five to seven days but may continue for up to two weeks. Vomiting usually does not last for more than three to four days. Caring for your child at home Reducing fever and pain relief for tummy aches Liquid paracetamol and ibuprofen can be given according the instructions on the bottle (Ibuprofen is not recommended if your child has asthma unless you have discussed with the doctor) Keep a record It is useful to keep a record of the number of drinks and the number of wees/ wet nappies that your child/baby has had each day. The Children\u2019s Nurses (CCN) will ask you about this when they call. Preventing Dehydration It is very important to follow the advice below to prevent dehydration in your baby/child; One of the main risks of gastroenteritis in children, especially babies, is that they may become dehydrated It is important to replace fluid your child will be losing due to vomiting and/or diarrhoea. It is OK if they do not want to eat. Drinks are most important, and most will start eating when they feel better. Continue to breast/bottle feed your baby. For a child under one, give small sips every few minutes (using a teaspoon or a plastic syringe and aim fluids into side of mouth to ease swallowing) Your CCN/Doctor will advise you how much and how often For all children, give drinks little and often e.g. every  mins (or as advised by the CCN/Doctor). If they are thirsty and take too much at a time, it may cause them to vomit. For older children, try using ice lollies or encourage drinking through a straw. Unwell children will often refuse fluids, but can be persuaded if you persevere Oral rehydration solution such as Diaorlyte or Electrolade should not be used in infants under three months without agreement from the doctor Type of fluids Good fluids Oral rehydration sachets, water, squash (not sugar free), milk Bad Fluids Juice, fizzy drinks which make diarrhoea worse Signs of Dehydration Dry mouth Dry tongue and lips Less tears when crying Sunken eyes Passing less urine than normal Weakness Being irritable or lethargic Worried about your child? Use traffic light advice GREEN: If your child has none of the symptoms in the amber or red categories, continue to look after them at home Continue to follow your CCN Hospital@Home advice AMBER: If your child has ANY of these Appears to be getting worse or if you are worried OR is getting more thirsty despite drinking OR is not drinking OR has signs of dehydration (see above) OR blood in their poo OR + bouts of diarrhoea in  hours OR + vomits in 24hrs OR has a high temperature OR is in constant pain YOU NEED TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE: Please call CCN H@H on   8am to 8pm,  days a week Or GP Out of Hours via NHS111 RED: If your child has signs of dehydration AND becomes unresponsive OR is breathing faster than usual OR has unusually pale or mottled skin OR has colder hands and feet than normal YOU NEED EMERGENCY HELP CALL : You need to be seen at an emergency department (A&E) Accessible leaflets This page contains legacy documents in PDF format which may not fully comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

    "text": "What is concussion? \nConcussion is a traumatic brain injury  which is often caused by a bump, blow \nor jolt to the head and affects the way the brain normally works. It can occur \nfrom a fall or blow to the body which causes the head and brain to move \nquickly back and forth. Concussion can happen anywhere, for example during \nsports, in the playground, or at home and must always be taken seriously. \nIf a child or young person is thought to have concussion they should \nimmediately stop whatever activity they are doing and be assessed by a \nmedical professional for a diagnosis and guidance. A second concussion can \nbe extremely serious. Each concussion is different and not everyone reacts \nin the same way. The key to a good recovery is physical and mental rest, \nfollowed by a gradual return-to-school (RTS), physical activity, and sport.\nConcussion symptoms \nConcussion can resolve within a few days \nor weeks. For some students the symptoms \nof concussion can linger and have the \npotential to cause longer term academic \nand social difficulties. In the short and long-\nterm, concussion symptoms can also have \na significant impact on classroom learning \nand schoolwork ( see symptoms right ).Cognitive\n\u2022 Feeling mentally foggy\n\u2022 Fatigue\n\u2022 Feeling slowed down\n\u2022 Difficulty concentrating\n\u2022 Difficulty remembering\n\u2022 Difficulty focussing\nSleep\n\u2022 Difficulty falling asleep\n\u2022 Sleeping more than usual\n\u2022 Sleeping less than usual\n\u2022 Drowsy\n\u2022 Altered sleep schedulePhysical\n\u2022 Headache\n\u2022 Dizziness\n\u2022 Balance difficulties\n\u2022 Nausea and vomiting\n\u2022 Fatigue \n\u2022 Sensitivity to light and noise\n\u2022 Visual problems\nEmotional \nand Behavioural\n\u2022 Irritability\n\u2022 Sadness\n\u2022 Nervous/anxious\n\u2022 Frustration\n\u2022 Anger\n\u2022 More emotional than usual\nWhen can the student RTS and \nresume normal activities? \nA period of immediate rest is important  \nafter a concussion. However, prolonged \nabsence from school is not recommended \nbecause it can be associated with \nincreased symptoms and may be \ndetrimental to recovery1. The RTS guidance \noverleaf allows the student to participate \nand learn without worsening their symptoms. \nTeachers should monitor the student \ncarefully and consider what adjustments \nmay be required (see examples right).Examples of support for the student\u2019s RTS\n\u2022  Initially reduce class time  \ne.g., later start time and/or \nshortened day\n\u2022  Allow student to avoid crowded \nand noisy environments e.g., \nlunch hall or corridors\n\u2022  Consider providing  \nemotional support \n\u2022  Provide opportunities for \nrepetition and review\n\u2022  Allow more time to  \ncomplete work\u2022  Permit the use of headphones or \nsunglasses if student is sound or \nlight sensitive\n\u2022  Provide a quiet workspace and/\nor rest breaks during lessons\n\u2022  Increase physical activity \ngradually, and follow guidance \nregarding engagement in PE\n\u2022  Provide reassurance\n\u2022  Remain flexible to fluctuating \nneeds and be prepared to scale \nback if necessary\nCONCUSSION  \nRETURN-TO-SCHOOL GUIDANCEN-ABLES\nThe National Acquired Brain Injury\nin Learning and Education Syndicate\nKey facts \n  All concussions are serious\n  Most concussions \noccur without loss of \nconsciousness\n  Recognising concussion \nwhen it first occurs and \ntreating it correctly \ncan help recovery and \nprevent further injury\nFor further information about supporting a student with concussion in school go to: \nhttps://www.thechildrenstrust.org.uk/brain-injury-information/info-and-advice/what-is-acquired-brain-injury/concussion-in-\nchildren-and-young-people\nhttps://childbraininjurytrust.org.uk/how-we-help/cbit-in-hand/\nSymptoms of\nconcussion \nRed flags: Get medical help immediately if \nthe student has any \u2018red flag\u2019 or worsening \nsymptoms such as neck pain, repeated \nvomiting, increased confusion, seizures, and \nweakness or tingling in their arms or legs. \nThese may be signs of a more serious injury.\nStep by step return-to-school guidance following concussion\n(This is for guidance only and does not replace medical advice.

It's not usually serious, but it's important to get medical help if your child has a seizure. A febrile seizure can seem frightening, but it's unlikely to harm your child or cause long-term effects. Check if it's a febrile seizure A febrile seizure can happen when a child has a high temperature (fever) . Your child may: become stiff and twitch, shake, or have jerking movements become unconscious not respond or look at you when you talk to them be sick or pee (wet themselves) be sleepy, irritable or confused for up to  hour afterwards Febrile seizures usually last for  to  minutes. It's rare for them to last more than  minutes. They usually affect children between  months and  years old. Immediate action required: Call  or go to A&E if your child: has a seizure for the first time has a seizure that lasts more than  minutes is having difficulty breathing has stiffness and twitching on only  side of their body is more sleepy than usual for more than  hour after the seizure stops has more than  seizure within  hours Do not take your child to A&E if they are still having a seizure or are unconscious, call  instead. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call  and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. What to do if your child is having a febrile seizure If your child is having a febrile seizure, it's important to keep them safe while you wait for medical help. Do check the time the seizure starts and ends protect their head with your hands or something soft remove any dangerous objects that are nearby after the seizure ends, put your child in the recovery position and make sure there is nothing in their mouth or throat that might affect their breathing Don\u2019t do not move your child or try to hold them in place do not put anything in your child's mouth do not try to lower your child's temperature by undressing them or sponging them with cold water Information: Find out how to put a baby in the recovery position on the St John Ambulance website Treatment for febrile seizures Most febrile seizures do not need treatment. But your child will need to be checked in hospital after having a febrile seizure for the first time. They may also need to stay in hospital for a short time. Your child may need some tests, including: blood tests pee (urine) test a lumbar puncture \u2013 where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses If an infection is causing your child's high temperature, they may need medicine to treat it. Treatment for recurrent febrile seizures Very rarely, a child may keep having febrile seizures. If this happens, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to give to your child while they're having a seizure. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to use it. Preventing febrile seizures You cannot prevent febrile seizures. They can sometimes happen when your child has an infection and a high temperature. Information: Febrile seizures and epilepsy Febrile seizures are not the same thing as epilepsy . Children who have had a febrile seizure have a slightly increased chance of having epilepsy later in life, but this is rare. Page last reviewed:  June  Next review due:  June",

Self care Using the advice below and overleaf you can provide the care your child needs at home. Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention How can I look after my child? For practical advice refer to \u2018Fever advice sheet\u2019 - download via Healthier Together website. If your child has a fever and is distressed, you can give them paracetamol (calpol) or ibuprofen . However, remember this might not stop them having a further febrile convulsion and fever is a natural response to infection. Always follow instructions on the bottle and do not exceed daily maximum doses. Never give your child aspirin. Tepid sponging is not recommended \u2013 it does not reduce fever and may cause your child discomfort. Febrile Convulsions (febrile seizures) Febrile convulsions occurs in some children with a high temperature (fever). Although it can be extremely scary the first time you see your child have one, most of the time they are not serious. Most occur with common illnesses such as ear infections, colds and other viral infections. Full recovery with no permanent damage is usual. The main treatment is aimed at the illness that caused the fever. Who gets them? They occur in about  in  children, most commonly between  months and  years of age They often occur on the first day of an illness associated with fever. There appears to be no connection between how high a child\u2019s fever is and whether they have a fit. They can occur even with mild fevers Most children will not have another fit during the same illness  in  children who have a febrile convulsion may go on to have further febrile convulsions in the future. This is more likely if other members of the family have had febrile convulsions. Febrile convulsions are not epilepsy. Regular treatment for prevention of future fits is usually not necessary. There is a small risk of your child developing epilepsy in the future and many parents worry about this, however, most children who have childhood simple febrile convulsions grow out of them and do not develop epilepsy If your child has had a previous febrile convulsion, has a clear cause for their fever, their seizure stops quickly and they are back to normal soon after, they may be cared for at home. The first time your child has a fit, you should go to your local Emergency Department or call an ambulance Once they have been examined, if a cause is found and your child is well, it may be appropriate that they are discharged to continue recovering at home What should you do? When the fit stops, you can give them Paracetamol or Ibuprofen . However, this might not stop them having another one. Always follow instructions on the container and do not exceed daily maximum doses For more information on fever please see our page here . How long will the symptoms last? In most cases, children with simple febrile convulsions appear dazed and their eyes may roll back Their bodies may go stiff, their arms and legs may twitch or shake and they will become unresponsive for a few seconds. It is unusual for the febrile convulsion to last for more than  minutes Your child may be sleepy for a few minutes afterwards Occur in about  in  children, most commonly between  months \u2013  years of age. They often occur on the first day of a febrile illness. There appears to be no connection between the extent of the fever and convulsions, so they can occur even with mild fevers. Simple febrile convulsions generally last less than  minutes, involve the whole body becoming stiff then jerking of all  limbs (a tonic clonic seizure) and the child may be sleepy afterwards but should return to their normal self within a couple of hours.  in  children who have febrile convulsions may have further convulsions with febrile illnesses in the future. Regular treatment for prevention of future seizures is usually not necessary. Febrile convulsions are not epilepsy. There is a small risk of your child developing epilepsy in the future and many parents worry about this, however, most children who have childhood simple febrile convulsions grow out of them and do not develop epilepsy. If your child has had a simple febrile convulsion, has a clear infection source that is causing their fever and you and the medical team are happy, they may be cared for at home. What to do if your child has another convulsion: Place them in the recovery position \u2013 on their side, on a soft surface with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit and keep their airway protected. Stay with your child and try to jot down what time their seizure starts and stops. Do not put anything in your child\u2019s mouth. If the seizure lasts longer than  minutes seek immediate medical help \u2013 call  or go to the nearest A&E. If the seizure lasts less than  minutes \u2013 phone your GP or NHS  for advice if you\u2019re worried. If you child appears to have a seizure(s) in the absence of fever, then please seek an urgent review with your GP. It is often extremely helpful if you or a family member are able to take a short video of your child when they are having their seizure.

    "text": "\ufeff What to do if someone has a seizure (fit) - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search What to do if someone has a seizure (fit) If you see someone having a seizure or fit, there are some simple things you can do to help. It might be scary to witness, but do not panic. If you're with someone having a seizure: only move them if they're in danger, such as near a busy road or hot cooker cushion their head if they're on the ground loosen any tight clothing around their neck, such as a collar or tie, to aid breathing turn them on to their side after their convulsions stop \u2013 read more about the recovery position stay with them and talk to them calmly until they recover note the time the seizure starts and finishes If the person is in a wheelchair, put the brakes on and leave any seatbelt or harness on. Support them gently and cushion their head, but do not try to move them. Do not put anything in their mouth, including your fingers. They should not have any food or drink until they have fully recovered. When to call an ambulance Call  and ask for an ambulance if: it's the first time someone has had a seizure the seizure lasts longer than is usual for them the seizure lasts more than  minutes, if you do not know how long their seizures usually last the person does not regain full consciousness, or has several seizures without regaining consciousness the person is seriously injured during the seizure the person has difficulty breathing after the seizure People with epilepsy do not always need an ambulance or to go to hospital every time they have a seizure. They usually have a care plan agreed with doctors and their family or carers that says what to do when they have a seizure, such as giving emergency medicine. If you know what to do and have been trained then you can follow their care plan. Some people with epilepsy wear a special bracelet or carry a card to let medical professionals and anyone witnessing a seizure know they have epilepsy. Epilepsy Action has more information about seizures that last longer than  minutes . Make a note of any useful information If you see someone having a seizure, you may notice things that could be useful for the person or their doctor to know: What were they doing before the seizure? Did the person mention any unusual sensations, such as an odd smell or taste? Did you notice any mood change, such as excitement, anxiety or anger? What brought your attention to the seizure? Was it a noise, such as the person falling over, or body movements, such as their eyes rolling or head turning? Did the seizure happen without warning? Was there any loss of consciousness or altered awareness? Did the person's colour change? For example, did they become paler than usual, flushed, blue or grey? If so, where \u2013 the face, lips or hands? On brown or black skin, changes in colour may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids. Did any parts of their body stiffen, jerk or twitch? If so, which parts? Did the person's breathing change? Did they perform any actions, such as mumble, wander about or fumble with clothing? How long did the seizure last? Did the person lose control of their bladder or bowel? Did they bite their tongue? How were they after the seizure? Did they need to sleep? If so, for how long? The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) also has useful leaflets you can download about a first seizure without a fever in children and young people . Keeping a seizure diary If you have epilepsy, it can be helpful to record the details of your seizures in a diary. Read more about seizure diaries and download one for free from: Epilepsy Action: keeping a seizure diary Epilepsy Society: seizure diaries Page last reviewed:  December  Next review due:  December",

Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention How can I look after my child? Keep monitoring your child for red and amber features (see above). Seek help if they develop, as this may suggest a more severe illness requiring specific investigations and treatment. Keep your child as comfortable as possible. Consider giving paracetamol or ibuprofen for comfort. Offer them simple food and regular drinks. If they are vomiting, offer small frequent drinks as this is more likely to stay down. Do not try to control your child\u2019s temperature with tepid sponging or fans. Keep an eye on your child day and night and follow the guidance overleaf. If a rash appears do \u201cthe glass test\u201d (see guidance overleaf). If your child is due their vaccinations, postpone until after their fever has improved. Notify their school if you need to keep your child away while they are unwell and have a fever \u2013 see Healthier Together website for advice if you are unsure whether they need to be kept off school or not. About fever in children Most children with a fever do get better very quickly but some children can get worse. You need to regularly check your child during the day and also through the night and follow the advice given below. Fever is extremely common in children and usually suggests that your child has an infection. Your child has a fever if their temperature is over \u00b0C. The most accurate way of measuring your child\u2019s temperature is with a digital thermometer. Viral infections are far more common than bacterial infections. Symptoms such as runny nose, cough, wheeze, sore throat, red eyes and diarrhoea are more suggestive of a viral infection than a bacterial infection. If a number of people are unwell in the same household, this also suggests a viral infection. Viral infections tend to get better on their own and do not need treatment with antibiotics. During a viral illness we would expect to see ongoing temperatures for - days and then a slow and gradual improvement of symptoms. If your child becomes more unwell after a period of initial improvement, then seek medical input. Using medicines to help If your child is distressed you should consider giving them paracetamol or ibuprofen to help them feel more comfortable. Use one and if your child has not improved - hours later you may want to try giving the other medicine. Carefully read the instructions on the medicine for dose and frequency. You could ask your local pharmacist for more advice about medicines. In general, we do not recommend cough medicines. The Glass Test Do the \u2018glass test\u2019 if your child has a rash. Press a glass tumbler firmly against the rash. If you can see the spots through the glass and they do not fade as you press the glass onto the skin then this is called a \u2018non-blanching rash\u2019. If you see this type of rash, seek medical advice immediately. The rash is harder to see on dark skin so check paler areas, such as palms of the hands, soles of the feet and tummy.

    "text": "\ufeff Constipation in children - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search Constipation in children Constipation is common in childhood, particularly when children are being potty trained at around  to  years old. Symptoms of constipation in children Your child may be constipated if: they have done less than  poos in the last week their poo is large and hard their poo looks like \"rabbit droppings\" or little pellets they are straining or in pain when they poo they have some bleeding during or after having a poo, because their poo is large and hard they have a poor appetite or stomach pain that improves after they poo If your child is over  year old, soiled pants can be another sign of constipation, as runny poo (diarrhoea) may leak out around the hard, constipated poo. This is called overflow soiling. Causes of constipation in children Constipation in children has many possible causes. Sometimes there's no obvious reason. Some of the possible causes include: not eating enough high-fibre foods like fruit and veg not drinking enough fluids feeling pressured or being regularly interrupted while potty (or toilet) training feeling worried or anxious about something \u2013 such as moving house, the arrival of a new baby, or starting nursery or school If your child is constipated they may find it painful to poo, which may mean they do not want to try to poo. This can create a vicious circle; the more they hold back, the more constipated they get. How to treat your child's constipation If you think your child may be constipated, take them to a GP. The treatment for constipation depends on your child's age. The longer your child is constipated, the more difficult it can be for them to get back to normal, so make sure you get help early. Laxatives are often recommended for children who are eating solid foods, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. It may take several months for the treatments to work, but keep trying until they do. Remember that laxative treatment may make your child's overflow soiling worse before it gets better. Once your child's constipation has been dealt with, it's important to stop it coming back. A GP may advise that your child keeps taking laxatives for a while to make sure their poo stays soft enough to push out regularly. Treating constipation with soiling (children pooing their pants) Getting constipated and soiling their clothes is not something your child is doing on purpose, so there's no reason to get cross with them. You may both find the situation stressful, but staying calm and relaxed is the best attitude to help your child deal with the problem. A health visitor or GP can offer helpful tips. Read about soiling (children pooing their pants) .

Your child may be constipated if: They don't poo at least  times a week Their poo is often large, hard and difficult to push out Their poo looks like 'rabbit droppings' or little pellets If your child is potty trained, soiled pants can be another sign of constipation. This is because runny poo (diarrhoea) may leak out around the hard, constipated poo. This is called overflow soiling If your child is constipated, they may find it painful to poo. This can create a cycle: the more it hurts, the more they hold on to poo. The more constipated they get, the more it hurts and so on. Even if pooing isn't painful, once your child is really constipated they may try to avoid going to the toilet altogether. Why do Children get Constipated?

Getting constipated and soiling their clothes isn't something your child is doing on purpose, so there's no reason to get cross with them. Staying positive and relaxed is the best attitude to help your child and praising positive steps is important. If your child is potty training, they may be feeling anxious or stressed about using the toilet. This can cause them to hold in their poo and lead to constipation. Give your child plenty of time to use the toilet while they are still learning. Encourage them when they do use the toilet. Some parents find a reward chart works. If you think your child is having difficulty with toilet training, you can also chat to your health visitor. If your child remains constipated despite the advice above, speak to their GP who can decide if they need medicines. The treatment for constipation depends on your child\u2019s age. The longer your child is constipated, the longer it can take to get back to normal. Make sure you get help early. If your child develops new or more severe tummy ache please see our page . Laxatives are often recommended for children, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. It may take several months for the treatments to work. Keep trying until they do. Remember that laxative treatment may make your child's overflow soiling worse for a time before it gets better so consider the impact, for example on school trips. Once your child's constipation has improved, it's important to stop it coming back. Your GP may advise that your child keeps taking laxatives for a while to make sure their poo stays soft enough to push out regularly. The medicines are safe and don\u2019t cause a lazy bowel.

It starts with red bumps that become small, yellowish blisters affecting the whole body \u2013 including the mouth and genitals (which can be very painful). They then open before scabbing over. These are very itchy and can make your child miserable. They may have a temperature, a cough and a runny nose. Children are able to pass the virus to others from the day before the rash appears until the last spot has scabbed over. Chickenpox rarely needs treatment, unless in a new-born baby, or in a child with a known weak immune system ( i.e. weakened immune system due to anti-cancer treatment, immunosuppressive treatment or genetic immunodeficiency).

It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious. Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis , which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages. Symptoms of bronchiolitis The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C. A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as: breathing more quickly finding it difficult to feed or eat noisy breathing (wheezing) becoming irritable Symptoms are usually worst between days  and , and the cough usually gets better in  weeks.

Some children, especially those under  weeks of age or young children with heart or lung problems, can develop worse breathing difficulty and may need to go to hospital for help supporting their breathing and feeding.

What to look out for Scarlet fever is an illness caused by a bug called Group A Streptococcus, which is found on the skin and in the throat. Scarlet fever mostly affects children and can easily spread to other people. Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in the last few years there have been a number of outbreaks. It is important that children with scarlet fever are assessed by a healthcare professional so that they can be started on antibiotics. The scarlet fever rash often begins with small spots on the body that then spread to the neck, arms and legs over the next  to  days. The rash may be harder to see on darker skin tones. It often feels like 'sandpaper' but is not itchy. Your child may also have a: Sore throat or tonsillitis Fever (temperature of \u00b0C or above) Painful, swollen glands in the neck A red tongue (strawberry tongue) \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIf your child also has a runny nose with their sore throat, it makes a diagnosis of scarlet fever and Group A strep less likely. If you think that your child is likely to have scarlet fever, you should by reviewed by a healthcare professional.

Please ring your GP surgery or call NHS  - dial  If symptoms persist for  hours or more and you have not been able to speak to either a member of staff from your GP practice or to NHS  staff, recheck that your child has not developed any red features. AMBER Green If none of the above features are present Watch them closely for any change and look out for any red or amber symptoms If your child has any other symptoms associated with their fever, you may want to look at the information on sore throat , cough , earache , diarrhoea and vomiting or tummy ache or our other pathways . Additional advice is also available to young families for coping with crying of well babies \u2013 click here . If your child has a long term condition or disability and you are worried please contact your regular team or follow any plans that they have given you. Self care Continue providing your child\u2019s care at home. If you are still concerned about your child, speak to your health visitor , local pharmacist or call NHS \u2013 dial  Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should stay at home. They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend. This guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention Does your child need antibiotics? If a healthcare professional thinks that your child has strep throat or scarlet fever, they will prescribe your child antibiotics. This reduces the chance of their infection becoming more severe but more importantly also stops them spreading the infection to others (after  hours of starting antibiotics), especially to people at higher risk of severe infections such as the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. My child has been in close contact with someone with Strep A - do they need antibiotics? If your child has been in close contact with a case of scarlet fever or strep throat, they do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless they are showing signs of infection (severe tonsillitis with fever in the absence of a runny nose or signs of scarlet fever). Only in exceptional circumstances will the local public health team recommend for an entire school class to be treated with antibiotics. My child has been diagnosed with scarlet fever or strep throat and is on antibiotics - what do I need to look out for? Your child may continue to have a fever for a few days after starting antibiotics. Very rarely, Group A streptococcus can spread to other areas of the body (invasive group A strep), causing infections in the neck (tonsillar abscesses or lymph node abscesses), behind the ear (mastoiditis), chest infections (pneumonia), bone and joint infections (septic arthritis) or sepsis . Look at the red /amber /green information below to help identify if your child has features of invasive group A strep or other complications of Group A strep.

Adapted from the Berlin 5th International concussion consensus statement 2016. \n\nIntroduction .......................................................................... 3\nWhat is concussion, \nthe causes, risks and symptoms ...................................... 4\nSymptoms of concussion \u2013  what you are told and questions to ask .......................... 5\nImmediate management of  a suspected concussion ..................................................... 6\nRed flags in concussion \u2013 urgent hospital transfer ...... 6\nOngoing management of a concussion  or suspected concussion .................................................... 7\nThe three phases of concussion treatment ................... 8\nGRTS \u2013 Graduated return to sport  ................................... 9\nFrequently asked questions ............................................ 11\nAthlete checklist for concussion management .......... 12ContentsIF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 2\nThis information is intended for the general public \nand for grassroots sport participants, where specialists in sport and exercise medicine are  not available to manage concussed individuals.\nAt all levels in all sports if an athlete is suspected \nof having a concussion, they must be immediately removed from play. If in doubt, sit them out. No-one should return to play on the same day with suspected concussion. No-one should drive, operate machinery or drink alcohol after  a suspected concussion. \nAll head injuries should be assessed by \na healthcare professional. Those who are suspected of being \u2018knocked out\u2019 or have persisting symptoms such as headache, vomiting or unusual behavior, need to be reviewed  in an accident and emergency department (A&E). \nAny player with a second concussion within  \n12 months, a history of multiple concussions, players with unusual symptoms  or prolonged recovery should be assessed and managed  by health care providers with experience in  sports-related concussions. Introduction\nThe following guidance is intended to provide information on how to \nrecognise sports concussion and on how this should be managed from the \ntime of injury through to safe return to play.IF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 3CONCUSSION FACTS  \n \nA concussion is a brain injury\nAll concussions are seriousMost concussions occur without loss of \nconsciousness\nAnyone with any symptoms following a head \ninjury must be removed from playing or training and must not take part in any physical activity until all concussion symptoms have cleared\nSpecifically, there must be no return to play on \nthe day of any suspected concussion \nReturn to education or work takes priority over \nreturn to play\nIf in doubt, sit them out to help prevent further \ninjury or even death\nHead injury can be fatal\nMost concussions recover with time and a \nstaged return to normal life and sport\nWhat is concussion?\nConcussion is a traumatic brain injury resulting in \na disturbance of brain function. There are many symptoms of concussion; common ones being headache, dizziness, memory or concentration disturbance or balance problems. It can be very difficult to tell concussion apart from other more serious injuries, such as bleeding on the brain.\nLoss of consciousness, being knocked out,  \noccurs in less than 10% of concussions.  Loss of consciousness is not required to  diagnose concussion.  \nWhat causes concussion?\nConcussion can be caused by a direct blow to the head, but can also occur when knocks to other parts of the body result in rapid movement of the head e.g. whiplash type injuries. \nWho is at risk?\nConcussions can happen at any age. However, children and adolescents (aged under 19): \n\u2022 are more susceptible to concussion \n\u2022 take longer to recover  \n\u2022 have more significant memory and mental   \n processing issues \n\u2022 are more susceptible to rare and dangerous   \n neurological complications, including death  \n caused by a single or second impact  \nA history of previous concussion increases risk of \nfurther concussions, and other sports injuries which may take longer to recover.Onset of symptoms\nThe first symptoms of concussion can present at any time, but typically appear in the first 24-48 hours following a head injury.\n \nHow to recognise a concussion\nIf any of the following signs or symptoms are present \nfollowing an injury the player should be suspected of having a concussion and immediately removed from play or training. \nSpotting impacts capable of causing concussion \ncan be difficult in a fast moving sport. It is the responsibility of everyone \u2013 supporters, officials, coaches and parents, to look out for athletes with suspected concussion and ensure they are safely removed from play.\nIF IN DOUBT, SIT THEM OUT. \nVisible clues of concussion \u2013 \nwhat you see\nAny one or more of the following visual clues can \nindicate a concussion:\n\u2022 Dazed, blank or vacant look\n\u2022 Lying motionless on ground / slow to get up\n\u2022 Unsteady on feet / balance problems or falling   \n over / incoordination\n\u2022 Loss of consciousness or responsiveness\n\u2022 Confused / not aware of plays or events\n\u2022 Grabbing / clutching of head\n\u2022 Seizure (fits)\n\u2022 More emotional / irritable than normal for  \n that personIF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 4\nSymptoms of concussion \u2013 \nwhat you are told\nPresence of any one or more of the following signs & \nsymptoms may suggest a concussion:\n\u2022 Headache \n\u2022 Dizziness \n\u2022 Mental clouding, confusion, or feeling  \n slowed down \n\u2022 Visual problems\n\u2022 Nausea or vomiting\n\u2022 Fatigue\n\u2022 Drowsiness / feeling like \u201cin a fog\u201c /  \n difficulty concentrating\n\u2022 \u201cPressure in head\u201d\n\u2022 Sensitivity to light or noise\n\u2022 Concerns expressed by parent, official,   \n spectators about a playerQuestions to ask \u2013 and when  \nto ask them \nAny suspicion of concussion, as a result of \nsymptoms or behaviour, should result in permanent removal from play with no further assessment. Occasionally concussion can be present when a player ceases activity due to a different, more obvious, injury e.g. a shoulder injury. The following questions may help you identify a possible concussion in this setting. \nThese should be tailored to the particular activity \nand event, but failure to answer any of the questions correctly may suggest a concussion. Examples with alternatives include:\n\u201cWhat venue are we at today?\u201d    \nor  \u201cWhere are we now?\u201d\n\u201cWhich half is it now?\u201d    \nor \u201cApproximately what time of day is it?\u201d\n\u201cWho scored last in this game?\u201d   \nor \u201cHow did you get to here today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat team did you play last game?\u201d  \nor \u201cWhere were you on this day last week?\u201d\n\u201cDid your team win the last game?\u201d  \nor \u201cWhat were you doing this time last week?\u201d \n \nIF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.IF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 5These questions should not be used as a filter \nto keep someone on the pitch. Concussion can still be present despite correct answers.\nImmediate management of a \nsuspected concussion \nAnyone with a suspected concussion should be \nIMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM PLAY. \nOnce safely removed from play they must not be \nreturned to activity that day. \nIf a neck injury is suspected the player should only \nbe removed by emergency healthcare professionals with appropriate spinal care training. \nTeam mates, coaches, match officials, team \nmanagers, administrators or parents who suspect someone may have concussion MUST do their best to ensure that they are removed from play in a safe manner.Red flags in concussion \u2013 urgent \nhospital transfer\nIf ANY of the following are reported then the \nplayer should be transported for urgent medical assessment at the nearest hospital:\n\u2022 Severe neck pain \n\u2022 Double vision\n\u2022 Weakness or tingling / burning in arms or legs\n\u2022 Severe or increasing headache\n\u2022 Seizure (fit)\n\u2022 Loss of or deteriorating consciousness  \n (more drowsy)\n\u2022 Repeated vomiting\n\u2022 Increasing confusion or irritability \n\u2022 Unusual behaviour change\nIn all cases of suspected concussion it is \nrecommended that the player is referred to a medical or healthcare professional for diagnosis and advice, even if the symptoms resolve. \nAnyone with a concussion or suspected concussion \nshould not:\n\u2022 be left alone in the first 24 hours\n\u2022 consume alcohol in the first 24 hours, and   \n thereafter should avoid alcohol until free of all   \n concussion symptoms\n\u2022 drive a motor vehicle and should not return   \n to driving until provided with medical or   \n healthcare professional clearance or, if no   \n medical or healthcare professional advice is   \n available, should not drive until free of all   \n concussion symptomsIF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 6\nOngoing management of \na concussion or suspected concussion\nREHABILITATE THE PERSON, REHABILITATE \nTHE BRAIN, RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE, RETURN TO SPORT\nA slow, stepwise return to normal life and then sport \nis the cornerstone of concussion treatment. After a short period of rest, a staged return to normal life at a level that does not produce symptoms of concussion is the main aim \u2013 then finally a staged return to sport. Aim to return to normal life \nbefore sport when recovering from concussion\nParticipants should be symptom free and have \nreturned to normal school or work activities, as well as have evidence of completing a staged returning to learning and returning to sport protocol.\nThose younger than 13 may need to take longer \nover their rehabilitation and return to sport, with medical guidance being sought. Return to competitive or uncontrolled sport should be longer than 23 days in those aged under 13.\nSymptoms persisting for more than 14 days in \nadults and four weeks in children are abnormal and the athlete should be reviewed by a doctor.\nRecovery from a suspected concussion \u2013 \nRehabilitate the person, Rehabilitate the brain.IF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 7\nPhase 1 \u2013  Relative rest period \nTake it easy for a 24-48 hour period after a \nsuspected concussion. Once your symptoms have settled, you can begin daily activities that don\u2019t bring on the symptoms of concussion. It is best to minimise your physical activity, screen time and reading to 10-15 minute slots.  \nIf an activity doesn\u2019t feel right or is making you feel \nunwell, you should back off. Use this time to find the right balance. Early medical review should be sought if symptoms persist through or beyond the relative rest phase of 24-48 hours. \n \nPhase 2 \u2013  Return to normal life \n(RTNL)\nAfter a couple of days you can begin to work \ntowards doing a small amount of paperwork, school or study activities, aiming towards a full return.  You should do this gradually, slowly building up the amount and type of activity you do. You can do more around the house, socialise more, involve more hobbies, do some work from home and gradually build to a full return to your work or school. \nIf you don\u2019t feel right at any stage, then back off a bit \nand make an appointment with your doctor. Don\u2019t try to return to sport or training just yet, limit it to very light physical activity that doesn\u2019t cause you any symptoms\nReturn to normal life should progress through four \nstages. There are no absolute time limits between progression of each stage, and this should be guided by symptoms. However, 24-48 hrs are recommended between each stage.   Return to normal life pathway\nSTAGE 1  Aim: Focus on return to daily activities \u2013 Rehabilitate the brain through reading, television, games etc. Typically activities should begin with 5-15 minutes sessions at home and then gradually increase back to full participation.\nSTAGE 2 \nAim: Focus on increasing tolerance \u2013 Once daily activities are tolerated on an unlimited quantity then home based school or work related activity, such as homework, reading or paperwork can be commenced.\nSTAGE 3  \nAim: Focus on return to study and work \u2013 part time return to school or activity in the workplace, e.g. half days, avoiding hard physical work, avoiding complicated study.\nSTAGE 4  \nAim: Focus on return to full academic or work related activity \u2013 return to full activity and catch up on missing work.  \nSpecial groups\nAlthough this guideline is a framework for the majority of the public, some groups may require a much slower progression and careful planning to return to normal life and sport. People with recurrent, prolonged or frequent previous concussions will require a longer recovery period, in addition to those with medical problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. \nPhase  3 \u2013 Return to sport\nOnce you are almost at full return to normal work or school, and providing you have no symptoms, you can begin a staged return to sport. See the guidance in the GRTS table on the next page about how much and of what type of activity you can do in each stage. You might need to work with your coach or teacher to find the right type of activity relevant to your sport. Once you have worked through the stages without symptoms and feel ready to return to competitive sport, you should seek a review by a healthcare professional experienced in concussion management or your doctor prior to playing.

There are absolute minimum timescales for individuals in different age groups to complete the process and return to sport. These are minimums, not targets. They are 12 days for an adult and 23 days for those aged under 19. Those aged under 13 may need even longer.\nSymptoms that persist beyond 14 days for adults \nand 4 weeks in those aged under 19 should be regarded as persistent symptoms and further medical review is required. The number of symptoms at the time of initial injury and past history of concussion may predict those in whom a longer, more conservative approach, may be needed. \nHow are recurrent or multiple concussions \nmanaged?\nAthletes with a history of two or more concussions \nwithin the past year are at greater risk of further brain injury and slower recovery, so they should seek medical attention from practitioners experienced in concussion management before returning to play.\nAny athlete with a second concussion within 12 \nmonths, a history of multiple concussions, athletes with unusual symptoms or prolonged recovery should be assessed and managed by health care providers (multi-disciplinary) with experience in sports-related concussions. \nIs concussion different in young children? \nYoung children may be more susceptible to \nconcussion and have prolonged duration of symptoms. They need to be managed more slowly and take longer before returning to sport.Do headguards and mouthguards protect against concussion?\nAlthough protective equipment may help protect \nagainst scalp wounds and dental trauma, and are recommended for safety in sports such as cycling, shinty or winter sports, there is no evidence that headguards and mouthguards protect players against sport related concussion. \nShould I see a doctor for my head injury?\nAll cases of head injury should seek early medical \nreview. All cases of concussion are advised to see a doctor or healthcare professional experienced in concussion management before returning to competitive sport. In adults, concussion symptoms would be expected to resolve in 10-14 days. In those aged under 19, the majority of symptoms should disappear by 4 weeks. Anything longer than this should seek a further review with a doctor, if they haven\u2019t already, \nWhat has changed in the Scottish advice since \n2015?\nThe guidelines have been updated in line with \nupdated international research and advice and informed by local expert experience. More priority is put on rehabilitating the brain injury and a return to normal life in a staged progressive fashion, rather than focussing on primarily returning to sport or absolute timescales. There was a large emphasis on absolute rest in the previous guidelines, but this time the advice is more about helping participants slowly progress through more complex stages of physical and mental activity that do not cause any symptoms. So more focus on rehabilitation through return to normal life rather than rest.IF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 11\nIF IN DOUBT , SIT THEM OUT.\nPAGE 12Athlete checklist for concussion management\nsportscotland concussion management checklist\nName:  \nAge:    \nIncident date:    \nIncident description: \n   \n \nRelative rest period  24-48 hrs with sub-threshold activity allowed   \nReturn to normal life Stage 1.

How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once. You can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first  days after symptoms start. To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease: wash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze bin used tissues as quickly as possible do not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash Staying off school or nursery Keep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling too unwell to go. But as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed. Keeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading. Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy Although there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease. This is because getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it. Speak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease. Page last reviewed:  May  Next review due:  May",

Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention Standard technique for use of inhaler and spacer Choose appropriate sized spacer with mask (or mouthpiece if child is over  years with good technique and is not significantly short of breath) Shake the inhaler well and remove cap Fit the inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer Place mask over the child\u2019s face ensuring a good seal Press the inhaler once and allow the child to take  slow tidal breaths between each dose Remove the inhaler and shake between every puff Repeat steps  \u2013  for subsequent doses Plastic spacers should be washed before 1st use and every month as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines For videos on using your child\u2019s inhaler and spacer correctly see goo.gl/235DQf Does this mean my child has asthma? No, not necessarily. This is a different condition from asthma, although a few children do go on to develop asthma. Children with asthma: Are often wheezy, even when they do not have a cough or cold Usually have a family history of asthma and allergy Are generally more breathless than their friends when they run around or become wheezy on exercise. Often have a regular night time cough If you are worried that your child has asthma, you should make an appointment to see your GP or GP asthma nurse. Follow up Although your child has not been diagnosed with asthma, your GP asthma nurse will usually be happy to review children with viral induced wheeze. If your child has been discharged from hospital, you should arrange for them to be seen in the next  hours by your GP or GP practice nurse. You should arrange for them to be reviewed by your GP if they continue to have lots of problems with wheeze once they have recovered from their cold. Treatment Over the next few days you should assess your child at least every  hours to make sure that they are recovering from their attack of wheezing. This is particularly important at night and first thing in the morning. If they are breathless or wheezy Give  puffs of blue inhaler one at a time using a spacer. Review their response after  minutes. If they are not improving give another  puffs and reassess. If they are still not getting better, repeat up to a maximum total dose of  puffs and reassess. If you are still worried after this: Give up to another  puffs of blue inhaler one at a time using a spacer. Seek urgent help by calling  or attend your local Emergency Department If they are not breathless or wheezy They do not need their blue inhaler. Continue to review them at least every  hours.

It's not usually serious, but can sometimes lead to kidney problems. It's more common in children, but adults can get it too. Symptoms of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) The main symptom of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) is a rash with raised red or purple spots. The spots look like small bruises or blood spots. The rash usually appears on the legs, bottom, tummy, chest or back. Credit: John Watney/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media//view There may be lots of spots or just a few. Credit: DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media//view You may also have pain or swelling in your joints, such as your knees and ankles. You may also have tummy pain. Credit: Don't Forget the Bubbles - Skin Deep: https://dftbskindeep.com/all-diagnoses/henoch-schonlein-purpura/#!jig[]/ML/ Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS  if: you or your child have a rash that does not fade when a glass is pressed against it but you do not feel unwell This could be Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP). You can call  or get help from  online . Immediate action required: Call  or go to A&E if: a rash does not fade when a glass is pressed against it and you feel very unwell \u2013 for example, it's painful to look at bright lights or you have a stiff neck This could be something serious like meningitis. Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call  and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Important: How to do the glass test Press the side of a clear glass firmly against the skin. Check a few times to see if you can still see the spots through the glass. If you have brown or black skin, check paler areas like the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

It usually gets better in a few weeks and you can usually just rest at home until you feel better. HSP cannot spread to others, so: your child can return to school or nursery when they feel well enough you can go back to work as soon as you feel up to it Treatment to relieve your symptoms Paracetamol can help ease any pain. Do not take ibuprofen without speaking to your doctor because it could harm your kidneys. Regular check-ups for kidney problems You'll have regular check-ups for  to  months to check how well your kidneys are working. You'll usually be asked to provide a sample of pee and have your blood pressure checked at each appointment. This may be done at home, at your GP surgery, or in hospital. Treatment in hospital You may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys. In hospital, you may be given strong medicines like steroids to help ease your symptoms. Risks of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) Most people with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment. But sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months. There's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged ( chronic kidney disease ). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups. Important: Getting HSP again You can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back.

They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend. Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention What should you do? Keep your child well hydrated by offering them lots to drink. Most children with coughs and colds do not require treatment with antibiotics. If your child seems to be in pain or discomfort, you can give your child Paracetamol or Ibuprofen , following the instructions on the container. Do not give cough syrup. It is not recommended for children under  years. It can make children sleepy and does not help. Try using saline nose drops or spray if your baby has a blocked nose. For children over  year, a spoon of honey (perhaps in a warm drink) half an hour before bed may help them to wake less often in the night. For children over  years, vapour rubs (containing camphor, menthol and/or eucalyptus) may help children sleep better. How long will your child's symptoms last? Coughs and colds can continue for weeks before they get better. Over the winter, children are likely to get one viral infection after another, which can make you think that they are never well. Things will get better in the summer months. Having a cough for  or  weeks does not mean that your child needs antibiotics. Children under  years of age with breathing difficulty may have bronchiolitis . This is a common condition that usually starts as a runny nose and cough, but their breathing may get worse over the next - days. If your child has noisy breathing, they might have croup . Treatment Most children with coughs/colds do no require treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics rarely speed up recovery and often cause side effects such as rash and diarrhoea. They will also promote the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria in your child. \u200d Prevention It is not always easy to avoid catching these infections. However, good hygiene practices can prevent infections spreading Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly Use a tissue when coughing or sneezing and put it in the bin Avoid sharing glasses or utensils with people who are unwell This guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight.

Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention Treatment Most children with otitis externa do not need antibiotics. That's because research has shown antibiotics make very little difference to how quickly your child gets better. If you think that your child has otitis externa, you should consider using % acetic acid ear drops (e.g. Earcalm), which is an effective treatment for otitis externa. These are available without a prescription from your pharmacist. If your child is still no better after a week of using acetic acid drops, they should see a GP who may consider starting them on antibiotic ear drops. If your child has redness extending to the skin around the ear (cellulitis), go and see your GP as they may need treatment with oral antibiotics. In addition, if your child has any features of severe infection (amber or red features above), they will need to be urgently seen by a healthcare professional who may decide that your child may benefit from antibiotic treatment. You can help relieve symptoms by: Giving your child paracetamol or ibuprofen to help relieve pain Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids Prevention It is not possible to prevent ear infections; however, you can do things that may reduce your child's chances of developing the condition. Avoid cleaning your child's ears with cotton buds - this may damage and irritate the ear canal and also push wax further into the ear. Wax is designed to come out by itself. Try not to let soap or shampoo get into your child's ear canal. Try to keep your child's ears dry; if water gets in, tip it out. This can be extremely challenging in young children!

    "text": "Depression & Low Mood | Signs, Symptoms & Treatment | YoungMinds Skip to main content Youngminds - fighting for young people's mental health Search Open main navigation Depression and low mood If you're worried that your child is feeling low or struggling with depression, here\u2019s our advice on what you can do and where you can find support. What is depression? Going through different emotions is part of life. While it can feel worrying, it\u2019s normal for a young person to have some down days. This can be part of growing up or a natural response to something that\u2019s happening in their life. If your child or young person is feeling low, they may seem more flat, tearful or irritable. But usually, they'll start to feel better in a few days or week. You may also notice that their mood lifts after a small change in their life. For example, after resolving a fall-out with a friend or getting to the end of a stressful time at school. When a young person is feeling depressed, low feelings last longer. This can make it difficult to enjoy things they normally would. It can also start to affect everyday activities like school or work. When a young person is experiencing depression, it\u2019s often difficult to feel better without extra support. Knowing that your child or young person is feeling depressed can be really worrying. Remember that lots of young people go through this, get help and start to feel better. We\u2019re here to help you support them and find the right help when they need it. Symptoms of depression While every young person is different, these are some common signs of depression: feeling down, sad or flat feeling numb or empty being more irritable avoiding friends, school or social situations not wanting to do things they used to enjoy feeling tired or not having any energy finding it hard to concentrate feeling negative about themselves feeling hopeless about the future having physical symptoms like trouble sleeping or a change in their appetite wanting to self-harm experiencing suicidal thoughts If your child or young person experiences one or two of these things, it does not necessarily mean they\u2019re struggling with depression. But if you\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s important to speak to a professional like a GP. How can I help my child or young person ? Gently check in with them It can help to start with an \u2018I\u2019 phrase like, \u2018I\u2019ve noticed you seem kind of down at the moment, can we have a chat about it?\u2019. It can also help to start the conversation while you\u2019re doing an activity, like walking or driving somewhere together. This can take the pressure off and make it easier for them to open-up. You can find more tips on starting a conversation in our guide for parents and carers. Starting a conversation with your child Listen and provide emotional support Try not to ask too many questions or come up with quick solutions. Focus on listening and showing you can see it from their perspective. Thank them for telling you about it, remembering that they\u2019ve taken a risk in opening-up. Let them know they can talk to you as often and for as long as they need to. Try not take it personally if you\u2019re on the receiving end of anger or frustration sometimes. Being more irritable can be part of feeling low, especially for children and young people. You can find more tips for making your child or young person feel really listened to in our blog. How to really listen to your child Try other things if they\u2019re finding it hard to talk Young people often find it difficult to talk to their parents or carers about how they\u2019re feeling. They might not know what to say, feel uncomfortable or be worried about upsetting you. In this situation you can: Try another way of speaking to them, like texting, messaging or writing a letter. Let them know you\u2019ll be there when they\u2019re ready and reassure them that you want to hear how they\u2019re feeling. Encourage them to speak to someone else they trust. This could be a relative or family friend. They might like to read our young people\u2019s guide to reaching out to help them decide who this person is. Encourage them to speak to a helpline by phone, chat, email or text. Think about what\u2019s making them feel this way Sometimes, children and young people feel low or depressed in reaction to events happening in their life. It could be : a problem with a friendship or family relationship being bullied or feeling left out at school feeling lonely feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork or the school environment struggling with a change such as divorce or separation in the family experiencing grief or loss going through a trauma , including witnessing or experiencing domestic violence or abuse Can your child or young person identify anything that\u2019s affecting them at the moment? Are there changes that could be made at home or school that would make things easier? Help them with daily self-care activities These things might sound simple, but they can have a big effect on our mood. They include: eating regular healthy meals and drinking enough water getting enough sleep and getting up a regular time doing some movement or exercise spending quality time with loved ones balancing screen time with other activities Encourage them to do things they enjoy If they\u2019re feeling very low in energy, you might want to start with something simple like watching a film or TV programme together. Or you can build up to things slowly. For example, if they usually enjoy exercising or playing sport, see if you can go for a short walk together. They can also listen to music or podcasts while you\u2019re walking. Work with them to make a support plan This is a list of the kinds of things that help when they\u2019re struggling. It might include: a list of their \u2018support circle\u2019 - the people they trust and feel comfortable reaching out to the type of support they would like from you activities that help them feel better the services or helplines they can reach out to a list of the professionals they can speak to when they need help \u2013 this might be their GP, counsellor, teacher or CAMHS worker Reassure them Keep letting them know that: you love them you\u2019re here for them these feelings will not last forever you can find support to help things feel better My son had become disconnected from life, and from all those who loved him. ... If any mother out there is experiencing a similar situation, my advice would be, play the mother\u2019s card of unconditional love. It's not your fault, and you cannot control how your child is feeling, but you can have hope that love will win the war over depression. A mother\u2019s story of her son\u2019s depression Get more tips from parents Try to find situations where your child might be more open and willing to talk to you, such as in the car or on a walk. Remember your child is not you, and their outlook and experience may be different to yours Allow your child some privacy but be available for them if they need you. Try not to \u2018fix things\u2019 - sometimes you just need to be there to listen. Sometimes the time when you least want to be there is the time you most need to be there. Try to find the things which might be causing pressure for your child, and find ways to remove them. Young people's advice for someone going through depression: Speak to your doctor or a trusted adult about how you\u2019re feeling. Don't be afraid to cry, especially if you're male \u2013 it helps to release emotions and you'll feel better afterwards. I\u2019ve found that identifying behaviours that are not beneficial to you \u2013 like endlessly scrolling through Instagram before bed and sleeping late \u2013 can be really helpful. Try to keep going outside, even if it\u2019s just a short walk, it can really help your mood to life. Realise that how you\u2019re feeling won\u2019t last forever and there\u2019s always something to look forward to. Finding professional support If you\u2019re worried about your child or young person\u2019s mental health, get professional advice. If they are struggling with depression, they may need professional help to feel better. They may also benefit from a specific diagnosis or treatment. Speaking to your GP Speaking to your GP is usually the first step to accessing mental health services through the NHS. The GP can explore how your child or young person is feeling.

This type of doctor is called a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Medication should only be offered to someone who is under  alongside talking therapy or another treatment.

They can find their local service and refer themselves for therapy on the NHS website . You can find out how to access counselling and therapy in our guide for parents and carers. Counselling and therapy Speaking to their school If your child or young person is struggling, it can help to be open with the school about what\u2019s going on. Depending on their age, it may be important to make sure they feel some control over the information that\u2019s shared about them. For example by asking them who they would feel most comfortable for you to speak to. Some schools provide a free counselling service to their students. Alongside this, schools may also offer: mentoring peer buddying clubs and activities advice through the school nurse Engaging Jack in categorisation games - animal or Lord of the Rings alphabets, shape/colour-searching in a room, ten likes/dislikes about someone or something (usually his sister) - helped in situations when the storm clouds were gathering. Supporting your child\u2019s mental health: a father\u2019s perspective If your child is having suicidal thoughts Some young people who are struggling with depression can experience feelings of no longer wanting to be alive or not being able to go on. This is known as experiencing \u2018suicidal thoughts\u2019. A young person can struggle with thoughts of suicide without acting on them. But suicidal thoughts can also develop into a plan or intention to attempt suicide. This means all suicidal thoughts should be taken seriously. If your child or young person is experiencing suicidal thoughts, it can be incredibly distressing. We\u2019ve got lots of advice about how you can support them and where you can find help in our guide for parents and carers. If they are having a mental health crisis and they need help now, find out who to contact on our urgent help page .

Looking after yourself as a parent Supporting a young person who is struggling with depression can be incredibly worrying. It\u2019s completely understandable it\u2019s affecting your own wellbeing. And it\u2019s so important that you get the support you need too. This could include: Asking for help This might look like asking someone to help with childcare so you can take a bit of time off. Or it might be meeting a trusted friend for an hour to talk things through. Reaching out to other parents Many parents find it helpful to talk to others who have been through similar situations. This could be reaching out to a parent you already know, or your local parent and carer forum. Or you might be able to find a local parent group using the Charlie Waller Trust directory . Accessing support If you need to, you can ask your GP about local services that provide support such as counselling or therapy. You can also access these services privately if it\u2019s an option for you. Sometimes it helps just having someone there to listen to what you\u2019re going through. If you need talk, you can call the Samaritans anytime on  . Look after yourself, as well as your child. I found it a frightening time, and very tiring.

    "text": "Drugs & Alcohol | Mental Health | Guide For Parents | YoungMinds Skip to main content Youngminds - fighting for young people's mental health Search Open main navigation Drugs and alcohol On this page, we\u2019ve got tips for talking to your child about alcohol and drugs. We also outline where you can find help if you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s drinking or drug use. It\u2019s normal for teenagers and young adults to experiment, test boundaries and take some risks. Drinking alcohol and trying drugs is one of the ways in which some young people do this. It is common for teenagers to drink alcohol at some point. A smaller number of young people will try illegal drugs, or smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes (often called \u2018vaping\u2019). A teenager or young adult might drink alcohol or take drugs for different reasons. They might do it because: it makes them feel good in the moment it\u2019s a way of having fun or socialising they are curious and want to test boundaries or try new things they want to fit in with a social group or feel pressure to do it it makes them feel more confident they want to distract from difficult thoughts or feelings As a parent or carer, it\u2019s important to talk to your child or young person about drugs and alcohol. By doing this, you can help them to understand the risks and support them to make safe and healthy choices. In this guide, you\u2019ll find lots of tips to help you. You\u2019ll also find information about where you can get help if you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s alcohol or drug use. Understanding the law and the risks Some drugs, such as alcohol and nicotine, are legal for people who are  or older. Some drugs, such as cannabis and cocaine, are illegal for anyone of any age to have or use. You can find out more about the law around drugs and alcohol on the Government\u2019s website: having and using drugs alcohol and young people When someone takes drugs, there is always risk involved. Using alcohol or drugs affects our judgement and decision-making. This can increase the risk of getting into dangerous situations. There is also always a risk of poisoning, having a bad reaction, or drinking or taking too much. You can find more information about the risks around drinking alcohol, smoking, vaping and taking illegal drugs on the Frank website. Frank also has advice about staying safe from drink spiking . Go to the Frank website How can drugs and alcohol affect mental health? Drugs and alcohol can have different effects on a young person\u2019s mental health. In the short-term, a young person\u2019s mood might change while they\u2019re drinking or taking drugs. They may feel happy, excited or relaxed. Or they may feel low, worried or on-edge. Afterwards, they might feel tired, anxious or a bit spaced-out. Over the longer-term, misusing drugs or alcohol can lead to serious mental health issues. Teenagers and young adults may be at greater risk of this because their brains are still developing. For example, some research shows that young people who use cannabis may be at greater risk of developing psychosis. You can find more information about the mental health risks associated with specific drugs on the Frank website . Drug and alcohol use can also be linked with mental health issues because: It can make existing mental health issues feel worse. This is because our emotions often feel more intense when we\u2019re drinking or taking drugs. We can also feel less able to cope in the hours or days afterwards. This can make issues like anxiety or depression harder to manage. If someone is struggling, they may start to use drugs or alcohol to cope. Drinking or taking drugs can be a way of numbing or distracting from difficult feelings or thoughts. But while it might sometimes feel like this brings short-term relief, it can make the problem worse over the long-term. Alcohol and drugs may affect them differently if they\u2019re taking medication for their mental health. Taking drugs with certain medications comes with a risk of serious side effects. Encourage your young person to talk to the GP about this when their medication is prescribed, so they understand the risks. If you\u2019re worried about this, you can speak to the GP yourself. You can also find more information on our medication pages . How can I talk to my child about alcohol and drugs? Have conversations as part of everyday family life Try to normalise talking about drugs and alcohol in your family. This will help your children to know that they can come to you for information and support when they need it. Treat conversations as an ongoing dialogue, rather than a one-off \u2018big chat\u2019. If your family's views around alcohol or drugs are connected to your faith or culture, you may want to include this in your discussions. Talk openly and honestly whenever they start asking questions Make it clear that it\u2019s okay for them to be curious and to have questions. Let them know you\u2019re happy to answer their questions. You can always tell them you\u2019ll find out the answer if they ask something you don\u2019t know. Be curious about what they know Show interest in their experience. Is alcohol talked about at school, or in their friendship group? What have they heard about alcohol and drugs? Do they know people who drink, or someone who\u2019s tried drugs? What do they think about this? How does it make them feel? Be clear about the risks without being judgemental Explain the risks to your child clearly. This is important for keeping them safe. It also helps them understand why you\u2019re worried about them drinking or trying drugs. They\u2019re more likely to listen if they know that it\u2019s coming from a place of care. Give examples of the risks that come with different drugs and allow them time to respond to these. Set boundaries Put agreements in place around how your child is going to stay safe when they\u2019re going out with their friends. Always make it clear that they can call you if they get into a situation that feels unsafe. Stay calm during conversations Try to do this even if your child or young person tells you something that worries you. Avoid getting angry, shouting, or telling them they\u2019re \u2018bad\u2019 for drinking or trying drugs. If they\u2019re worried that you will be cross, they might become secretive about what they\u2019re doing. Remember, you cannot help to keep them safe if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. If they do come to you, think together about what will help make sure they\u2019re safe. How to start a conversation if you\u2019re concerned It\u2019s important to look out for signs that your child\u2019s drinking or drug use is affecting their mental health or wellbeing. You can find a list of common warning signs further down this page. If you\u2019re worried, start by gently checking in with them. It might help to do this while you\u2019re out on a walk or doing an activity together. This can help to make it feel like less of a \u2018big chat\u2019 and encourage them to open up. Use an \u2018I\u2019 phrase like, \u2018I\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve been drinking more when you go out with your friends, can we have a chat about it?\u2019 Supporting your child to make safe and healthy decisions Model a healthy relationship with drugs and alcohol Before they start thinking about drinking or trying drugs themselves, your child or young person will be learning from what they see you doing. Reflect on your own relationship with drugs or alcohol. What messages might you be sending to them? Do some research so you feel confident and informed Things change with each generation. It\u2019s helpful to know what words are used, what the most common drugs are, and where people are getting them. This will help you feel confident when you\u2019re talking about them and setting boundaries. The Frank website is a good place to start. Support your child to deal with peer pressure Sometimes, a young person might feel like there is pressure to drink or take drugs when they do not want to. Friends or peers might tell them to do it or make them feel bad if they don\u2019t. They might also feel under pressure to explain why they aren\u2019t joining in. This can be particularly difficult for teenagers and young people, because it\u2019s often a time when \u2018fitting in\u2019 feels really important. Peer pressure can leave someone feeling worried, alone and even unsafe. In this situation, make it clear that: there are serious risks involved with drinking or trying drugs when it comes to drugs and alcohol, the only person who gets to decide what they do is them anyone who\u2019s making them feel this way is not being a good friend people who care about us should not push us to do things we\u2019re uncomfortable about someone often pressures people to do things when they\u2019re not feeling good about themselves \u2013 it says more about the person who is doing the pressuring than it does about them You can also look at Childline\u2019s guide to being assertive together. This might be helpful when they want to say no but they\u2019re not sure how. Over time, your child or young person may start to realise that they're spending time with a group of people who often make them feel bad about themselves. Listen to what this is like for them. Encourage them to join groups or clubs for the things they\u2019re interested in. This can help them to meet new friends. Explore what safe and healthy decisions look like for them This might include talking about: their own thoughts and feelings about alcohol and drugs how they can get to know their limits around alcohol, and stay within these how they can make choices that are right for them, rather than the choices they think they \u2018should\u2019 make what kind of people they want to spend time with, and how they want to be treated by their friends what they would say if they were offered alcohol or drugs when they didn\u2019t want them what they can do and say if they get into a situation which makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe When should I be worried about my child or young person? It\u2019s normal for teenagers to experiment. Some will drink alcohol or try drugs. But it is not normal for a teenager to: drink or take drugs alone get very drunk or take drugs frequently feel like they \u2018need\u2019 alcohol or drugs to cope with social events or other situations If you\u2019re concerned that your child is using alcohol or drugs to cope, it\u2019s important to get some help as soon as you can. Getting professional support can prevent things from getting worse. It can also support them to find healthier ways of coping. Speaking to a GP and looking into counselling and therapy are two good places to start. Signs your child or young person is developing a more serious problem: they are drinking alcohol or taking drugs frequently their drug or alcohol use causes changes in their mood \u2013 for example by making them more irritable, tired, anxious, low or agitated they are experiencing other mental health issues such as anxiety or low-mood they are losing interest in the things they used to do, including hobbies or schoolwork they have become secretive about what they\u2019re doing, or money or alcohol is regularly going missing they build up a tolerance, which means they need to have more and more to feel the effect once they start drinking or taking a drug, they find it difficult to stop and often end up drinking or taking a lot they feel like they \u2018need\u2019 to drink or take drugs to cope If your child is experiencing these things, you need to get specialist help as soon as possible. Where to get help for alcohol and drug problems Each local area has their own drug and alcohol service. Each service offers different types of support and treatment. This often includes things like counselling, recovery plans and family support. If your child or young person is under , this service might be at their local NHS mental health team for young people (known as CAMHS ). The first step to accessing alcohol and drug services is usually to make an appointment with a GP . The GP can discuss what\u2019s happening and refer your child or young person to the right place. Depending on where you live, your child or young person may be able to refer themselves to CAMHS, or to their local drug and alcohol service.

When your child or young person is struggling, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve done something wrong. Be kind to yourself. Keep in mind all you\u2019re doing to help them.

What is self-harm? Play Video: #NoHarmDone | A Parent's Journey | My Child Self-Harms | YoungMinds #NoHarmDone | A Parent's Journey | My Child Self-Harms | YoungMinds Self-harm is when someone hurts themselves on purpose to manage distressing or overwhelming feelings or experiences. Someone who is self-harming may be dealing with lots of intense thoughts and feelings. Hurting themselves can feel like the only way to cope. Or they might feel numb and hurt themselves so they can feel something. If your child is self-harming, or you\u2019re concerned they might be, it can be incredibly worrying. The important thing to remember is that lots of young people go through this and come out the other side with different ways of coping. You also need to remember that you\u2019re not alone. On this page, we outline how you can support your child and where you can find professional help. Signs a young person is self-harming Ways that young people self-harm Some ways that young people self-harm include: cutting themselves or pricking the skin with sharp objects scratching skin with fingernails deliberately picking open old wounds or scabs burning skin biting skin hitting themselves, or banging their head or another part of their body on a wall pulling at their head and body hair inserting objects into their body Things to look out for You might be worried that a young person is harming themselves, even if they're not talking about it or showing visible injuries. If you\u2019re concerned, you can look out for: unexplained cuts, burns, bite-marks, bruises or bald patches covering their body. They might wear long sleeves or trousers during hot weather, not want to change clothes around others, or avoid activities like swimming bloody tissues in bins seeming low or depressed, for example withdrawing from friends and family blaming themselves for problems or expressing feelings of failure, uselessness or hopelessness outbursts of anger or argumentativeness Having found out my child was self-harming, I was so devastated and confused as to why. My emotions were all over the place, not knowing how to help her, where to go for professional help \u2013 it was so stressful. As a father I just wanted to wrap her up in cotton wool. Reasons why a young person might self-harm If a young person is self harming, it\u2019s often a sign that something isn\u2019t quite right or has become too much to deal with. It can be understood as an important message about how a young person is feeling \u2013 one that needs to be noticed with care by the adults around them. Self-harm is usually a way of trying to manage very difficult feelings. People often harm themselves when life feels hard to cope with - when distressing feelings have built up and become overwhelming. In the moment, physical pain can be easier than feeling emotionally out of control. You might hear myths about self-harm, including that it\u2019s a \u2018phase\u2019, or attention-seeking. In fact, while it might feel hard to understand from the outside, self-harm can be a way for a young person to: manage, reduce or express very strong and upsetting emotions like hurt, sadness, anger, fear or feeling bad about themselves relieve tension and pressure, or reduce feelings of panic and anxiety, to temporarily feel calmer experience a feeling of physical pain to distract from emotional pain gain a sense of control over feelings or problems \u2013 for example by feeling there\u2019s something they can do when things feel too much stop feeling numb or \u2018zoned-out\u2019, a protective process our bodies use when we\u2019re overwhelmed. Yet while self-harm can bring relief in the moment, this is only temporary. As feelings build up again, so does the urge to self-harm. As this cycle continues, someone might start to feel ashamed, confused, or frightened. This increases the load they\u2019re already carrying, becoming a cycle that\u2019s hard to break and a habit that\u2019s hard to stop. Often it\u2019s a way for people to let out feelings that are hard to explain or control. You probably feel better at the time, but then the guilt sets in, and then it\u2019s just the cycle. It never really makes the emotion go away. Supporting your child with the urge to self-harm When the urge to self-harm does build, it's useful for your child to have a list of other things they can do instead. This can help 'ride the wave' of intense feelings without self-harming. Different things will work for different people. What helps usually depends on the feelings your child is trying to manage. If your child wants to feel soothed, they might want to wrap themselves up in a comfy space. If they want to burn off energy, doing something active can help. Your child might want to use an app like Calm Harm so they have something on their phone that suggests different techniques they can try when they feel the urge to self-harm. Strategies to try when they feel like self-harming Strategies could include: making and using a self soothe box writing down how they\u2019re feeling in a journal writing down difficult feelings on pieces of paper and then ripping them up ripping up a magazine or newspaper hitting a soft cushion, pillow or bean bag listening to loud music having a shower doing some exercise going for a walk outside, or taking the dog for a walk focusing on their breathing \u2013 how it feels in their body to breathe in and out wrapping up in a blanket or duvet. Some people find weighted blankets particularly useful talking to someone \u2013 a friend, family member or calling a helpline tidying or organising something doing a hobby they enjoy that helps them feel calm, such as painting, drawing, colouring-in, watching a favourite TV programme, playing video games, cooking or baking crossing the arms and placing one hand in icy water and the other hand in warm water - this creates an unpleasant \u201cshock\u201d effect, but is not dangerous using an elastic band over the wrist or other body part to produce a sensation of pain - this is safe and does not cause any permanent damage or injury Supporting your child to manage their feelings There are a number of things that might empower your child to feel more in control. Becoming more aware of what they're feeling when they self-harm can help, as can understanding what's making them want to do it. They might also want to think about what could help them stop. This knowledge can reduce overwhelm and their need to self-harm. To support them with this, you can: Try to open up a conversation about what\u2019s going on It might help to start this while walking outside or doing an activity to keep the chat more relaxed. It can also help both of you to be in a neutral space - e.g. not in their bedroom. Take a look at our activity ideas for starting a conversation . Understandably, you might have lots of questions. But it\u2019s important to remember your child is going through a tough time and may find this overwhelming. Focus on finding out how they\u2019re doing without bombarding them. Keep communication as open as you can, letting your child know they can talk to you anytime Your child might feel ashamed about self-harming and find it difficult to talk about. Let them come to you when they feel ready, and reassure them that they can talk to you as often and for as long as they need to. If your child is struggling to open up, they might find it easier to text or write a letter, or communicate how they feel through writing, pictures, or music. This can be particularly helpful for neurodiverse young people. Receiving information this way also gives you time to process what they\u2019ve told you, and think about how you\u2019d like to respond without immediately reacting. Stay calm and non-judgemental When your child does open up, try to focus on listening, showing empathy and being curious about what it\u2019s like for them, rather than trying to \u2018fix\u2019 things. Sometimes they'll just want you to listen and understand how they are feeling - not be given a solution. Think together about what\u2019s causing them to self-harm Self-harm is usually a symptom of something else that\u2019s going on. Are there things like relationships or experiences at home or school that are making them feel worried, frightened, upset or angry? Are there changes that could be made to make things better? Taking pressures away can help reduce feelings of overwhelm. Help them to notice when the urge to self-harm builds, and how they\u2019re feeling when that happens What kinds of thoughts are they having, and how do they feel in their body? For example, they might start to feel more zoned out or like they\u2019re full of panic. This can help them recognise what feelings they\u2019re trying to deal with, and what they can do instead to manage them. Keeping a mood diary might help them understand this over time - and can be as simple as a noted-down word, phrase or emoji every day. Spend quality time together doing activities they enjoy Even if it\u2019s just for a little while, doing something fun can give your child a break and help them relax. This might be drawing, making something, playing sport, cooking, or watching a favourite film together. Help them do the daily things that support our wellbeing Getting up at a regular time, eating regular healthy meals, exercising, drinking water, spending quality time with loved ones and getting enough sleep can help (teens need a minimum of - hours per night). It might help to think about limits around screen time as part of this. Ask your child if there are things that would help them to feel more safe Think about replacing potentially harmful everyday items with safer alternatives. Some young people, for example, might use the safety pins they use to secure their hijab or other items of clothing to harm themselves. In cases like this, you might want to secure clothes in a different way with magnets or clips. Certain things in the house might trigger them - ask them about this, and try to find ways to remove or reduce them. Keep an eye on your child without making them feel policed It\u2019s completely natural that you might want to watch over them when you know they self-harm. While monitoring the situation is good, sensing they\u2019re being watched may increase your child's anxiety and guilt. When it feels possible and they need it, give them some space. Seek professional advice or help There are lots of things you can do to help your child. But lots of young people will need professional help to shift the situation and feel better. You can find out how to access help below. Young people tell us it's helpful when parents... Are open-minded and don\u2019t make assumptions Remember that their child is not doing this for attention \u2013 it\u2019s their way of letting out the pain on their terms Let their child know they are there to help and aren\u2019t going to judge them Listen to them and offer reassurance. Things like \u2018I\u2019m proud of you\u2019, \u2018we will get through this together\u2019 and \u2018I recognise your pain and want to help\u2019 will go a long way. Young people tell us it's unhelpful when parents... Put too much pressure on their child to stop Force their child to talk when they\u2019re not ready Minimise their child\u2019s feelings by saying things like \u2018it\u2019s only puberty\u2019, \u2018it\u2019s just a phase\u2019 or \u2018you need to grow up\u2019. Empathise with their emotional state. Life is tough right now and it shouldn\u2019t be, but it is. Make sure your child knows there is so much they can do to make things better, and none of them involve attacking themselves or feeling bad about themselves. Check in with your child on a regular basis. It can be easy to feel that everything is back to normal when your child appears to be coping, but it\u2019s essential to monitor what's really happening for your child. Become your child\u2019s best critical friend \u2013 compassionate, supportive, encouraging them to seek help and confidential where it matters. My mum and dad came into my room and did something brilliant for me. They accepted it. They didn\u2019t shout at me or tell me off. Finding professional help There are different places to find help for your child. Speaking to your GP is often a good start. They can discuss concerns, speak to your child to find out how they\u2019re doing, and let you know what support options are available. You can speak to the GP yourself to ask for advice, even if your child doesn\u2019t want to talk to them. Depending on the situation, the GP can also refer them for an assessment by a mental health specialist, or to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) . Referrals can be made to CAMHS for young people up to the age of  years old, or to adult mental health services for young people aged  and over. Schools, colleges, and universities are another good source of support. They can also refer to mental health services, and often have their own mental health provision. Referrals from school can be very useful. They see the young person on a daily basis and can sometimes give more insight into their needs. Some young people may find it helpful to speak to a counsellor or therapist, who can help them make sense of how they\u2019re feeling and find new ways of coping. Our guide to counselling services takes you through the process of finding a counsellor or therapist for your child. More about getting support from mental health services Get support from our Parents Helpline Trying to find the right help for your child and finding your way around different services can be really tiring at times \u2013 so keep reminding yourself that you\u2019re doing your best and that it\u2019s not easy. Some young people who are self-harming will find it very difficult to speak to a professional, go to appointments or even acknowledge what\u2019s going on. If things are feeling stuck, you can call our Parents Helpline for information, advice and support. YoungMinds Parents Helpline Tips from parents who've been in this situation Parents have found the following things helpful when seeking professional help: If you\u2019re feeling under a lot of strain, or like the situation is too much to manage, it may be a sign you need professional help. Try to speak to professionals early on before things have escalated to crisis. Encourage your child to give themselves some time to get to know a professional and build trust. Remember that they might be starting from a very withdrawn place. Remind your child that therapy is not always easy. Finding it difficult is normal, rather than a sign it\u2019s not working. Ask if you can see the same professional each time so that you don\u2019t have to keep re-explaining the situation. Be open minded about different types of treatment. What works for your child might not be the same as what would work for you. Keeping your child safe It\u2019s important to take your child to hospital or to your GP if they have any injuries that require medical attention. Self-harm is often a way to help someone cope. It isn\u2019t necessarily an expression of suicidal feelings or an attempt to take their own life. But people who experience suicidal thoughts are more likely to have self-harmed in the past. If you\u2019re worried your child may be experiencing suicidal thoughts, read our guide to find out how you can access help. Guide to suicidal thoughts My child needs urgent help If your child is having a mental health crisis and needs urgent help now, find out who to contact on our urgent help page. If your child\u2019s life is at risk, or if it does not feel like they\u2019re safe, please call  for an ambulance or take them straight to A&E. My child needs urgent help Looking after yourself Finding out that your child is self-harming can be an incredibly distressing, or even traumatic, experience. It\u2019s completely normal to feel anxious, confused, sad, angry, frustrated, guilty or ashamed. Try to take time when you can to check in with yourself, and to think about ways you can take care of yourself too. It\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it, and to share your worries with someone you trust. Many parents in this situation find it helpful to reach out to other parents to talk through how they have handled difficult situations and found support. You may also be able to find a local parent support group using the Charlie Waller Trust directory . If you need more help, speaking to your GP is a good place to start. They may be able to refer you to a local support service. Sometimes it helps just having someone there who can listen to what you\u2019re going through. If you need someone to talk to, you can call the Samaritans any time on  . Try to ignore the feelings of guilt about helping yourself. You need to be well, both physically and mentally, to support your child to the best of your ability. You need to take extra care during this difficult time. Don\u2019t panic. Seek help. Make sure you\u2019re eating, drinking and sleeping properly yourself.

Your child has sustained an injury of the wrist bone which your doctor has diagnosed as a \u201cBuckle Fracture\u201d. What is a buckle fracture? A buckle fracture is a type of break to the bone, where the bone has been squashed. Children\u2019s bones are softer than adult bones and are more likely to squash rather than break after an impact. This can result in a bulge in the bone rather than a complete break. This injury is treated like a sprain and will not cause any long-term problems. Treatment Buckle fractures heal so well by themselves that you do not need any special treatment. A large scientific study that took place throughout the UK, called the FORCE study, investigated how best to treat these injuries. This study showed that children who were offered a bandage (which not all of them chose to wear) healed well and were equally as comfortable as those who were treated in a hard splint or cast. Most children start to use their wrist and hand comfortably again after a couple of weeks. They should be allowed to use the hand as much as they want, but shouldn\u2019t do anything that causes them pain or discomfort. If the child wears anything on their wrist (i.e. a bandage), then this should be removed whenever the wrist becomes more comfortable \u2013 and certainly by  weeks. When moving the wrist in the next few weeks they may complain of mild stiffness and aching. This is normal and should settle down quickly. Your child should be allowed to return to sporting activities, physical exercise and rough play as soon as the pain and discomfort settles. Follow up appointments We should not need to see your child again. All your X-rays will be reviewed by a specialist to check your child has been given the right treatment and ensure there are no other problems. They will contact you if they have any concerns, so please check that we have your correct details. Things to look out for when your child goes home Your child may have discomfort in their wrist which should settle over a few days.

Self care Using the advice below you can provide the care your child needs at home. Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention How can I look after my child? Avoiding dehydration and low blood sugar is important \u2013 give your baby/child extra fluids and make sure that they contain sugar. In the hospital, diluted apple juice is often used. To make this, simply mix half apple juice and half water (/). Please give this between feeds or after each watery stool. Little and often works best \u2013 in hospital babies and young children are given  or  tablespoons (-10ml) of apple juice to drink every - minutes. You can try using a syringe to give fluids to your child. Continue to offer your child their usual feeds, including breast and other milk feeds. Do not worry if your child is not interested in solid food. If they are hungry, offer them plain food such as biscuits, bread, pasta or rice. It is advisable not to give them fizzy drinks as this can make diarrhoea worse.
