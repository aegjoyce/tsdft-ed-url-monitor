    "text": "\ufeff Cuts and grazes - NHS Skip to main content Search the NHS website Search Cuts and grazes Most cuts and grazes can be treated at home and will start to heal in a few days. But some wounds may need to be treated by a medical professional if there's a risk of infection or the cut is serious. How to treat a cut or graze yourself You can treat a cut or graze yourself by stopping any bleeding, cleaning the wound, and covering it with a plaster or dressing. This will help stop it getting infected. If it's painful, you can take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (but do not give aspirin to children under ). What to do if the wound is bleeding a lot Check the wound and make sure there's nothing stuck in it. If there's nothing in the wound, put pressure on it using a bandage or a clean, folded cloth (such as a tea towel) for  minutes. If there's something stuck in the wound, do not try to take it out. Make sure not to press down on the object. Press firmly either side of it to push the edges of the wound together. If the wound is on your hand or arm, raise it above your head. If the wound is on your lower limb, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart. This will help reduce the blood flow. When the bleeding has stopped, firmly wrap a new bandage over the first cloth or bandage. If the wound keeps bleeding, leave the first bandage in place and add another one. Keep pressing firmly on the wound for another  minutes. How to clean and dress a cut or graze If the bleeding has stopped, you can clean a small wound and then put a plaster or dressing over it. Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them. Put on disposable gloves if you have some. Clean the wound by rinsing it with bottled or tap water, or by using sterile wipes. Clean the skin around the wound using soap and water or antiseptic \u2013 but try not to get antiseptic into the wound. Pat the area dry using a gauze swab or a clean tea towel. Put on a sterile dressing or a plaster. Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as you need. You can take it off after a few days, once the wound has closed. Information: Find out more How to apply plasters and other dressings How to apply a bandage Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS  if: a wound has soil, pus or body fluids in it, or it's still dirty after cleaning it you were bitten by a person or a wild or stray animal a cut is swollen, red and getting more painful or pus is coming out of it a cut is larger than around 5cm ( inches) you've cut yourself and also feel generally unwell or have a high temperature You can call  or get help from  online . Immediate action required: Call  or go to A&E if: you have a cut and cannot stop the bleeding the blood comes out in spurts and is bright red and hard to control you lose feeling near the wound or have trouble moving it you have a bad cut on your face or the palm of your hand the wound is very large or deep there's something stuck in the cut, such as a shard of glass \u2013 do not try to take it out yourself Find your nearest A&E Information: Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call  and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. Treatments for cuts and grazes How a cut or graze is treated will depend on how bad it is and if there's a risk of it becoming infected. The cut will be cleaned and closed with either stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is put over it. But the wound may not be closed straight away if it's infected or there's a risk it may get infected. You may also need to have an injection to prevent tetanus or be given antibiotics if the cut could be infected. Page last reviewed:  June  Next review due:  June",

In his ruling, Judge John Tunheim said \"they are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border\", adding that the refugees have a legal \"right not to be subjected to the terror\" of the current immigration enforcement. In January, the Trump administration announced the launch of Operation PARRIS which was meant to target and re-examine the legal status of Minnesota's , refugees who have not secured permanent legal status. Since then, the federal government has \"subjected more than  refugees, including children, in Minnesota to unlawful arrests, detentions and interrogations\", according to the criminal complaint. \"Some were subjected to intense questioning, while others have remained imprisoned for over a week, many shuffled between facilities in shackles,\" according to a statement from the International Refugee Assistant Project (IRAP), one of the participants in the lawsuit. Kimberly Grano, a lawyer from IRAP, says the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is \"a campaign of terror to try to strike fear into these communities\". Grano tells the BBC that some of the refugees detained were in the process of obtaining their legal permanent resident status, but that has been frozen since the government stopped processing most green card applications last year. \"These people are being arrested even if they have submitted a green card application, and the government is just choosing not to decide it,\" Grano says.

The \"targeted\" operations he was referring to are direct ones, aimed at specific individuals, rather than mass sweeps aimed at nobody in particular. That isn't to say that Homan is a moderate. He is, however, seen by people close to the Trump administration as someone who can work with state and local officials to prioritise public safety threats, and, the White House hopes, lower the public temperature. In his frequent appearances at the White House since the beginning of the administration, Homan has repeatedly said that any undocumented migrants caught up in \"targeted enforcement\" will also be processed for immigration violations. He repeated that again today, a fact which is unlikely to endear him to activists or immigration advocates, many of whom vividly remember his previous stance on family operations. For the White House, however, his presence in Minneapolis will be seen as a steady, experienced hand coming to solve both a law enforcement issue and a public relations one.

If you're only just joining us, here are the key lines from his update: Homan says his task is to \"regain law and order\" in Minneapolis and work to \"remove threats from the community\". He also says he will stay in the city \"until the problem is gone\" The border tsar says immigration enforcement operations will now focus on those who pose a risk to public safety with a more \"targeted\" approach He also says there will be a \"draw-down\" of operations in Minnesota - but doesn't provide a clear timetable of when that might happen The withdrawal of immigration enforcers is \"dependant on cooperation\" from local officials, Homan adds Asked about the shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti earlier this month, Homan says he will let the investigations play out. He adds that Trump has told him that he \"doesn't want to see anybody die\" The border tsar calls for a departure from \"dangerous rhetoric\" as he pledges that any agent who doesn't abide by codes of conduct will be 'dealt with' Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Border tsar says there'll be a 'draw-down' of operations in Minnesota - but doesn't say when published at  GMT  GMT Daniel Bush Washington Correspondent Image source, Reuters White House border tsar Tom Homan promises that the administration will make changes in the immigration operation underway in Minneapolis. But Homan says the speed of a \"draw-down\" of federal forces in the city would depend on the cooperation of state and local officials, adding that the Trump administration's larger immigration enforcement mission would continue. \"You're going to see a draw-down,\" Homan says, speaking at a press conference in Minnesota. He did not provide details on how many federal forces might leave the city, or when. Homan also defends President Donald Trump's immigration policies, and says that \"targeted\" enforcement aimed at removing undocumented immigrants would continue throughout the country. \"We are not going to surrender our mission at all, we're just going to do it smarter,\" Homan says. Homan's remarks underscored the administration's efforts in recent days to calm tensions in Minneapolis after federal agents fatally shot two US citizens in the city in recent weeks. At the same time, Homan - who was sent to Minneapolis this week by Trump to oversee the operation there - appeared focused on sending a message that the administration did not plan to back down on one of Trump effort to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the US.

The video shows an altercation between Pretti and federal officers  days before his death. A spokesperson for the Pretti family has confirmed the man in the video is the ICU nurse, with the family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyer adding that \"nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing\". Homan says he will not comment \"on any shootings\". \"We'll let the investigation play out and let it go where it goes,\" he says. \"I'm not going to come out and make any comments whether I think it's right or wrong.\" Homan says Trump has told him that he \"doesn't want to see anybody die\", adding that this includes people that federal immigration agents are looking for. He reiterates that he wants ICE agents to operate \"in the safety and security\" of jails rather than on the street. And that brings an end to Trump's border tsar's first news conference since his arrival in Minnesota.

He says criminality is the main focus, and that anyone who has come here illegally has committed a crime. He adds that \"no one is off the table\" in targeted immigration operations. Allowing undocumented immigrants in and letting them go through due process later is \"sending the wrong message\". The Trump administration, Homeland Security and ICE are working hard to combat national security threats. Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing",
