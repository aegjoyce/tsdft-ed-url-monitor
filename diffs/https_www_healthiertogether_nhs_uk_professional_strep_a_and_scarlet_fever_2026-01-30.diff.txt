What to look out for Scarlet fever is an illness caused by a bug called Group A Streptococcus, which is found on the skin and in the throat. Scarlet fever mostly affects children and can easily spread to other people. Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in the last few years there have been a number of outbreaks. It is important that children with scarlet fever are assessed by a healthcare professional so that they can be started on antibiotics. The scarlet fever rash often begins with small spots on the body that then spread to the neck, arms and legs over the next  to  days. The rash may be harder to see on darker skin tones. It often feels like 'sandpaper' but is not itchy. Your child may also have a: Sore throat or tonsillitis Fever (temperature of °C or above) Painful, swollen glands in the neck A red tongue (strawberry tongue) ​​​​If your child also has a runny nose with their sore throat, it makes a diagnosis of scarlet fever and Group A strep less likely.

This guidance is written by healthcare professionals from across Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. Advice and Guidance Self care and Prevention Does your child need antibiotics? If a healthcare professional thinks that your child has strep throat or scarlet fever, they will prescribe your child antibiotics. This reduces the chance of their infection becoming more severe but more importantly also stops them spreading the infection to others (after  hours of starting antibiotics), especially to people at higher risk of severe infections such as the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. My child has been in close contact with someone with Strep A - do they need antibiotics? If your child has been in close contact with a case of scarlet fever or strep throat, they do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless they are showing signs of infection (severe tonsillitis with fever in the absence of a runny nose or signs of scarlet fever). Only in exceptional circumstances will the local public health team recommend for an entire school class to be treated with antibiotics. My child has been diagnosed with scarlet fever or strep throat and is on antibiotics - what do I need to look out for? Your child may continue to have a fever for a few days after starting antibiotics. Very rarely, Group A streptococcus can spread to other areas of the body (invasive group A strep), causing infections in the neck (tonsillar abscesses or lymph node abscesses), behind the ear (mastoiditis), chest infections (pneumonia), bone and joint infections (septic arthritis) or sepsis .
