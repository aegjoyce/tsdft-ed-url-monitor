In his ruling, Judge John Tunheim said "they are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border", adding that the refugees have a legal "right not to be subjected to the terror" of the current immigration enforcement. In January, the Trump administration announced the launch of Operation PARRIS which was meant to target and re-examine the legal status of Minnesota's , refugees who have not secured permanent legal status. Since then, the federal government has "subjected more than  refugees, including children, in Minnesota to unlawful arrests, detentions and interrogations", according to the criminal complaint. "Some were subjected to intense questioning, while others have remained imprisoned for over a week, many shuffled between facilities in shackles," according to a statement from the International Refugee Assistant Project (IRAP), one of the participants in the lawsuit. Kimberly Grano, a lawyer from IRAP, says the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is "a campaign of terror to try to strike fear into these communities". Grano tells the BBC that some of the refugees detained were in the process of obtaining their legal permanent resident status, but that has been frozen since the government stopped processing most green card applications last year. "These people are being arrested even if they have submitted a green card application, and the government is just choosing not to decide it," Grano says.

Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Another possible government shutdown looms after Minneapolis shooting published at  GMT  GMT Bernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from Washington DC Today's cabinet meeting comes as the threat of another US government shutdown looms, with lawmakers reportedly engaging in negotiations about Trump's immigration enforcement action. US media report that the White House and Senate Democratic leadership are nearing an agreement which would meet Democratic demands to introduce new restrictions on federal immigration agents. If no deal is struck, the second shutdown within months will begin at one minute after midnight on Friday,  January. The spending bill has already passed in the House of Representatives, but needs  Senate votes to advance. Among the changes Democrats are seeking are requirements that federal agents obtain warrants before making arrests and clearer rules governing how they identify themselves, according to US media reports. There are only  Republican senators in the -member body, meaning that passing the bill will require at least some support from Democratic members. Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: "I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue." Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said that "productive" negotiations are ongoing. If changes are made, the bill will need to be re-approved by the House, which is currently on recess. On Wednesday, some Senate Democrats escalated their demands, expressly calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's removal, and structural changes to both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Border Patrol.

Homan has been a vocal defender of Trump's deportation goals, vowing to target the "worst of the worst" and has been a staunch defender of his highly contentious family separation policy - which led to children being separated from their parents who were in the country illegally. Last year, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he had been accused in a bribery case of accepting $, (Â£,) from undercover agents. The case was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt describing that case as an effort to "entrap" a key Trump ally.

The "targeted" operations he was referring to are direct ones, aimed at specific individuals, rather than mass sweeps aimed at nobody in particular. That isn't to say that Homan is a moderate. He is, however, seen by people close to the Trump administration as someone who can work with state and local officials to prioritise public safety threats, and, the White House hopes, lower the public temperature. In his frequent appearances at the White House since the beginning of the administration, Homan has repeatedly said that any undocumented migrants caught up in "targeted enforcement" will also be processed for immigration violations. He repeated that again today, a fact which is unlikely to endear him to activists or immigration advocates, many of whom vividly remember his previous stance on family operations. For the White House, however, his presence in Minneapolis will be seen as a steady, experienced hand coming to solve both a law enforcement issue and a public relations one.

But Homan says the speed of a "draw-down" of federal forces in the city would depend on the cooperation of state and local officials, adding that the Trump administration's larger immigration enforcement mission would continue. "You're going to see a draw-down," Homan says, speaking at a press conference in Minnesota. He did not provide details on how many federal forces might leave the city, or when. Homan also defends President Donald Trump's immigration policies, and says that "targeted" enforcement aimed at removing undocumented immigrants would continue throughout the country. "We are not going to surrender our mission at all, we're just going to do it smarter," Homan says. Homan's remarks underscored the administration's efforts in recent days to calm tensions in Minneapolis after federal agents fatally shot two US citizens in the city in recent weeks. At the same time, Homan - who was sent to Minneapolis this week by Trump to oversee the operation there - appeared focused on sending a message that the administration did not plan to back down on one of Trump effort to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the US.

Homan says he will not comment "on any shootings". "We'll let the investigation play out and let it go where it goes," he says. "I'm not going to come out and make any comments whether I think it's right or wrong." Homan says Trump has told him that he "doesn't want to see anybody die", adding that this includes people that federal immigration agents are looking for.

For the White House, however, his presence in Minneapolis will be seen as a steady, experienced hand coming to solve both a law enforcement issue and a public relations one.

If you're only just joining us, here are the key lines from his update: Homan says his task is to "regain law and order" in Minneapolis and work to "remove threats from the community". He also says he will stay in the city "until the problem is gone" The border tsar says immigration enforcement operations will now focus on those who pose a risk to public safety with a more "targeted" approach He also says there will be a "draw-down" of operations in Minnesota - but doesn't provide a clear timetable of when that might happen The withdrawal of immigration enforcers is "dependant on cooperation" from local officials, Homan adds Asked about the shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti earlier this month, Homan says he will let the investigations play out. He adds that Trump has told him that he "doesn't want to see anybody die" The border tsar calls for a departure from "dangerous rhetoric" as he pledges that any agent who doesn't abide by codes of conduct will be 'dealt with' Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Border tsar says there'll be a 'draw-down' of operations in Minnesota - but doesn't say when published at  GMT  GMT Daniel Bush Washington Correspondent Image source, Reuters White House border tsar Tom Homan promises that the administration will make changes in the immigration operation underway in Minneapolis. But Homan says the speed of a "draw-down" of federal forces in the city would depend on the cooperation of state and local officials, adding that the Trump administration's larger immigration enforcement mission would continue. "You're going to see a draw-down," Homan says, speaking at a press conference in Minnesota. He did not provide details on how many federal forces might leave the city, or when. Homan also defends President Donald Trump's immigration policies, and says that "targeted" enforcement aimed at removing undocumented immigrants would continue throughout the country. "We are not going to surrender our mission at all, we're just going to do it smarter," Homan says. Homan's remarks underscored the administration's efforts in recent days to calm tensions in Minneapolis after federal agents fatally shot two US citizens in the city in recent weeks. At the same time, Homan - who was sent to Minneapolis this week by Trump to oversee the operation there - appeared focused on sending a message that the administration did not plan to back down on one of Trump effort to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the US.

The video shows an altercation between Pretti and federal officers  days before his death. A spokesperson for the Pretti family has confirmed the man in the video is the ICU nurse, with the familyâs lawyer adding that "nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing". Homan says he will not comment "on any shootings". "We'll let the investigation play out and let it go where it goes," he says. "I'm not going to come out and make any comments whether I think it's right or wrong." Homan says Trump has told him that he "doesn't want to see anybody die", adding that this includes people that federal immigration agents are looking for. He reiterates that he wants ICE agents to operate "in the safety and security" of jails rather than on the street. And that brings an end to Trump's border tsar's first news conference since his arrival in Minnesota.

Homan does not give a figure. Instead, he says there's been some rotations, which happen "all the time". "My main focus now is draw down," he tells the press. Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing 'No one is off the table' in targeted immigration operations published at  GMT  GMT Homan is asked about people ICE agents are looking for and if they will target those simply for being undocumented. He says criminality is the main focus, and that anyone who has come here illegally has committed a crime. He adds that "no one is off the table" in targeted immigration operations. Allowing undocumented immigrants in and letting them go through due process later is "sending the wrong message". The Trump administration, Homeland Security and ICE are working hard to combat national security threats.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino had agents stopping US citizens and asking them for ID, creating fear, the reporter says. It took the death of Alex Pretti for us to get here. How did this happen? Who made the decision for this operation to proceed in this way? Homan responds, claiming that up to , people per day were coming across the border under the previous Biden administration. A massive deployment of ICE agents was needed to deal with this "humanitarian crisis" and secure the border, he says. We brought extra resources in to provide security, he adds, saying that resources can be drawn down when violence and hateful rhetoric decrease. Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing
