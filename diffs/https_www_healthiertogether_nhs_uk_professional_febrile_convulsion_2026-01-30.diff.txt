What to do if your child has another convulsion: Place them in the recovery position – on their side, on a soft surface with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit and keep their airway protected. Stay with your child and try to jot down what time their seizure starts and stops. Do not put anything in your child’s mouth. If the seizure lasts longer than  minutes seek immediate medical help – call  or go to the nearest A&E. If the seizure lasts less than  minutes – phone your GP or NHS  for advice if you’re worried. If you child appears to have a seizure(s) in the absence of fever, then please seek an urgent review with your GP. It is often extremely helpful if you or a family member are able to take a short video of your child when they are having their seizure.
